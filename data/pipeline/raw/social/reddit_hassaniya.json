As you can tell, Maltese is also a Semitic language derived from the Sicilian Arabic/Siculo-Arabic variant that uses Latin letters as well. Jiena ferħet li biex titgħallem aktar jekk il-kelliema Ħassaniya hawn jistgħu jgħinu! (I'm pleased to learn more if the Ħassaniya speakers here could aid me)",

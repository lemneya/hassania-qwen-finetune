Notes to the Learner:
     The purpose of The Grammar Handbook is to help you focusyour
attention on matters such as how to form the past tense or to make
nouns and adjectives agree, or to put a string of words together in the
proper order. The Grammar Handbook aims through explanation,
example and exercises to help you assimilate the linguistic system that
holds together the words and phrases of Hassaniya.
     Used together, The Communication and Culture Handbook and The
Grammar Handbook are two complementary approaches to a basic mastery
of Hassaniya. You may find that you are more comfortable with one
than cvith the other, but once again, let us remind you thateveryone
learns differently. This language course, by taking these two ap-
proaches allows you to capitalize on your strengths. It should be
pointed out that it would be unwise to neglect either book. If you
studied only The Communication and Culture Handbook you would only
be able to function within its situations. If you studied only The
Grammar Handbook, you would learn quite a lot about the grammar of
the language, but not be able to put your knowledge to use in basic
everyday situations.

                                 THE ARTICLE
                                  Lesson One




      There is no equivalent in Hassaniya to the English indefinite
article "a ". Thus a noun standing alone is automatically indefinite.
Examples:
     a house        /da: r/

     a man          /ra : jil/

     a woman        /mara : /

     a car          /wa : ta/
                                                  `u \:)

     The definite article "the" has two main forms in Hassaniyya.
1.   If the first letter of the noun is a "moon" letter, /ill
     is prefixed to the noun :
Examples:

                    goodness                                    the goodness
     /khay r/                        /il-khayr/
                        -1. P                                           X'   k

                    praise                                      the praise
     ihamd/            Ax-?          /il-hamd i

     For your reference, the 14 "moon" letters are:



Ls


                                     *1*

THE ARTICLE                                                                         N ONE




2.      If*the first letter of the noun is a "sun!' letter, the /1/ of (ill
        is assimilated and replaced by a doubling in prenuneiati,)n o.. the
        first letter of the word, i.e. the /1/ of               Iis chipped in
        pronunciation.
Examples:

                         peace                               the peace
        /sala:mi                               /is-sala:m/            _>L^13\,
                                 man                                the man
        /ra:jil/         3_                    /ir-ra:jil/
                              I/                                         k



                                 house                              the house
        /da :r/                                /id-da:r/                     )) k
                              1 ")



Note:

        Although the /1/ is dropped in pronunciation, it is still written in
        written Arabic, and this doubling in pronunciation is indicated by
        the /shadda/ written above the first letter of the word.
        For your reference the 14 "sun" letters are:




                                                                                            ...

Special Notes:
     You will sometimes hear Al/ become Ai/ in front of words begin-
     ning with two consecutive consonants. This may take time for
     you to pick up in normal speech, and this feature may vary de-
     pending on where you are in Mauritania. However you will always
     be understood using /ill, and this note is only to help you in
     your comprehension as you gain confidence and experience in hear-
     ing and speaking Hassaniya.
     The /i/ of /i3/ is dropped in two cases:
          a.     If the preceding word ends with a vowel.
          b.     If the word to which hi/ is prefixed begins with a
                 vowel.

    The personal pronouns in Hassaniyya are:

Note:
        1.   There are four forms of "you" in Hassaniya. You must dis-
             tinguish between "you" when referring to either a man, a
             woman, a group of men or a group of women.
        2.   Mixed groups of men and women are treated grammatically as
             masculine plural.
        3.   There is no equivalent to the English "it" . Since all nouns in
             Hassaniya are either masculine or feminine you use either
             "he" or "she" in context when referring to a thing "it" .

                                              *6*

LESSON TWO                                              PERSONAL PRONOUNS




Since there is no verb "to be" (in the present tense) in Hassaniya,
simple sentences like "I am a nurse", "she is the director", "it (refer-
ring to a book) is expensive", "it (referring to a house) is large" can
be rendered simply by using the relevant pronoun plus the noun or
adjective.

Examples:
     I am a nurse.                   /ana tabi:ba/
       (woman talking)                                                 .._.    1    0cl.,.....,




     He is the director.             /huwa l-mudi:rj

     It is expensive.                /huwa wa: cir/
       (book)

     It is large. (tent)             /hiya ikbi:ra/             ii. j..)   1       (5.9

Further Note on Plurals:
    The plurals of most masculine and feminine nouns referring to oc-
cupations, and adjectives referring to mental and physical states are
formed thus:
     (Masculine nouns + adjectives describing people)
    Add /i:n/           Zi_   to the last letter of the word:

             teacher          /mucallim/

             teachers         /mucallimi: n/


             hungry           ijica : n/

             hungry        /ji.. ca:m:n/
                                     .

                                Lesson Three




     The possessive pronouns "my", "your", "his", "her", etc. are in-
dicated in Hassaniya by suffixes attached to the last letter of the noun
they describe.
    The possessive suffixes and their English equivalents are:
         my             /V
                                               L5

 LESSON THREE
                                                   POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS




     Here is a table showing all
ple noun. This is the Hassaniyathe possessive suffixes joined to a sam-
                                 for "name".
Example:
        my name             /ism-i/

        your name (m.)      /ism-ak/

        your name (f.)      /ism-ik/

        his name            /ism-u/

        her name            /ism-ha/

        our name            /ism-na/

        your name (pl.)     /ism-kum/

        their name         /ism-hum/

Note:
        1.   There are 3 forms of "your" in ,Hassaniya. You must dis-
             tinguish between "your" referring to either a man, a woman,
             or a group of people.
    2.       There is no equivalent to English "its". Since all nouns are
             either masculine or feminine, you use either "his" or "hers"
             in context when wanting to say the equivalent to "its".

     When the possessive suffixes are added, to a feminine noun ending
with a /ta : ' marbu : to /, the /ta : ' marbu : ta/ is "opened" - i. e. it is both
pronounced and written as a regular /ta : '/.
Examples :

        our car              /wa : tat-na/

        his tent             /khaymat-u/

        my town              /dashrat-i/
Note:
        If   a noun has a possessive suffix it cannot also take the definite
        article /il l . However adjectives describing a noun with a posses-
        sive suffix must have the definite article.
Examples :

        my new house         /da: r-i 1-ijdi: da/          6 )-3 )-R >)`   Qs- i \ -)

        his big tent         /khaymat- a 1-ikbi: ra/

        her small son        /walad-ha 1-isqi: r/
Note:
        The possessive suffixes join directly to the last letter of the noun
        they describe. However if the last letter is a non-connector, the
        suffix will stand alone.

     Singular nouns in Hassaniyya are either masculine or feminine.
Feminine nouns generally end in /ta:' marbu: to /, however there are a
very few words not ending in /ta:' marbu:ta/ which are feminine.
Examples - masculine nouns:
     goodness              /khayr/
                                                       5"/'

    With nouns referring to occupations, and adjectives referring to
    mental and physical states, the feminine equivalent is formed by
    adding a /ta:' marbu:ta/ to the masculineform.

Examples:
    nurse (m.)             /tabi:b/

    nurse (1.)             /tabi:ba/

     In Hassaniya nouns have threeforms depending on the number of
things being talked about: singular, dual (two of something) and
plural.
1.   The singular form of nouns has been discussed.
2.   The dual is a unique feature of Arabic. The suffix /-ayn/
             can be added to any noun to denote "two of". If the noun
     is feminine ending in a /ta:' marbu: t a/ the
                                                      latter must be
     "opened" - i.e. pronounced and written as a regular
     the /-ayn/ c:f suffix is added.

3.   The Plural:
     Unlike English, the plural form of a noun in Hassaniya cannot be
     stated in a simple rule. You must learn the plural form of a
     noun at the same time as the singular. However, use your judge-
     ment; do not waste time learning the pluralof nouns you rarely
     use in the plural. An additional peculiar feature of Hassaniya is
     the fact that "countable" n uns (like "books") revert to their
     singular form when expressed in quantitites above 10, so really
     the use of the plural is limited in "countables" to quantities be-
     tween 3 and 10.

     2.      Feminine nouns in their singular and plural forms .
             Many feminine nouns ending in /ta : ' marburta/ drop the /ta : '
             marbu : t a/ and add /a: t/ ,::-. to make the plural. Unfor-
             tunately this is not a hard and fast rule but, as you will see,
             is fairly common.
Examples :

                                    Lesson Eight




     As you have already seen, there is no equivalent in Hassaniya for
the English verb "to be" (in the present tense at least). However,
there is a way of conveying the idea of existence, "there is/there ar,"
or "there was/there were" in Hassaniya. This word is:
                      /kha:lig/
                                         631-i
and can be used in statements (affirmative and negative) as well as in
questions when speaking about availability or existence of somethingor
somebody.
     Note that /kha:lig/      tfc' behaves like an adjective, that is, it
takes the regular feminine singular  and feminine and masculine plural
suffixes depending on who or what is beiag referred to.
Example - Affirmative Statements
     There is rice in the market today.
     /kha: lig ma:ru vi 1-marsa il-yawm/cy.1\           j.1     .,


    There is a tent in the house.

Questions:
     These statements can be made into questions simply by usinga
rising intonation on the last words in your voice. There is no change
in word order for questions with /kha:lig/.


Examples - Negative Statements
      The negative "there isn't/there aren't", or in the interrogative,
"isn't there?/aren't there?" is formed by placing /ma/                 1,,   before
/kha : lig/:
      There isn't any rice in the market.

                                Lesson Nine




      You have seen earlier that phrases like "thenew car" in Hassaniya
translate literally as "the car the new" with both noun and adjective
preceded by the definite article /ill.
     However, since there is no verb "to be" in Arabic, sentences on
the pattern of "The house is big" can be formed witha noun plus the
definite article followed by an adjective alone, translating literally into
Hassaniya as "the house big".
Examples:
               The house is big.
               /id-da:r ikbi:ra/

               The car is small.
               /il-wa:ta sqi:ra/


      Note the difference in meaning between:
1.             The big house...
               /id-da:r l-ikbi:ra/

and
2.             The house is big.
               /id-da:r ikbi:ra/


     Make sure that you don't say one while meaning the other. Of the
two, '"The house is big." is a complete sentence in itself and can stand
alone, while "the big house" is not a complete sentence.

Negation:
    Simple sentences like "The house is big" are easy to build since
there is no verb "to be" (in the present tense) in Hassaniya. You
negate such sentences with the formula shown in Lesson 4.

              The house isn't big.

to the English object pronouns "me", "you", "him",as"hcr",
these suffixes used on conjunction with the preposition /'and/etc.

    Although this translates literally as "near me", "near you", etc.,
in Hassaniya it expresses the same idea of "possessing", "owning", or
"having" as "I have ..." and "I have got..." do in English.

Note:
        1.   There are three forms of "you have" in Hassaniya. You must
             distinguish between "you have" referring to either a man,
             woman or a group of people.
        2.   There is no equivalent to English "it has". Since all nouns
             are either masculine or feminine you mustuse either "he has"
             or "she has" when referring to a thing depending on its
             gender.
    3.       Note that since the last letter of /cand/ is a non-connector all
             the suffixes stand alone unjoined.

Negative of /cand/
     The negative is formed by placing /ma/ I, before /cand/. /ma/
is invariable.

Examples:
    I don't have                 /ma cand-i/

    you (m.) don't have          /ma cand-ak/

    you (f.) don't have          /ma cand-ik/

    he doesn't have              /ma cand-u/

    she doesn't have            /ma cand-ha/

    we don't have               /ma cand-na/

    you (pl.) don't have        /ma cand-kum/

    they don't have             /ma c and-hum/

    The other kind of sentence in which "this", "that", "these", and
"those" are most commonly used is in the pattern:
                        This (noun) is (adjective).
                        This house is new.
In the Arabic for sentences on this pattern you must use /ill, "the",
with the noun. Thus the sentence "This house is new" literally trans-
lates into Hassaniya as "This the house new."
Examples:
            This house is new.
            /ha:dhi id-da:r ijdi:da/           °-)4 .)-4' k    ik;3\   L.S:k1'

                            Lesson Twelve




     The Present Tense in Hassaniya obeys a regular and predictable
pattern: each verb consists of a "stem", in many cases made up of 3
letters which conveys the meaning of the verb.
     "I", "you", "he", "she", etc. are indicrted by prefixes and suf-
fixes added to the stem. These prefixes and suffixes remain absolutely
constant from one verb to another.
     The prefixes are added to the "stem" by one of the short vowels
which we will call the "helper" vowel which remains the same within any
one verb. You may hear some regional differences in Mauritania as to
which short vowel is used as the "helper" vowel in some verbs, and
you may find that the short vowels used in examples in this book are
not always what you will hear in different parts of the country. In the
early stages of learning Hassaniya, follow your teacher's pronunciation
and advice. When you are on your own, keep your ears open and
imitate what you hear used most often around you.
     Here are three common verbs written in all the "persons":
Examples:   "write"
    I write             /niktub/

    you write (n.)      /tiktub/

    you write (f.)      /tiktubi/            ....5,...,S... )-




    he writes           /yiktub/

    she writes          /tiktub/

    we write            /niktubu/

    you write (pl.)     /tiktubuj

    they write          /yiktubu/

     As you can see, the prefixes and suffixes are quite regular:

                                     verb stem
     I                          n
     you (m. )                  t
     you (f.)                   t           i
     he                         v,

     we                         n           u

     they                       y           u


     The only possible source of confusion may be that you (m.) and
she are the same in pronunciation and writing. However, context will
always tell you whether a man is being addressed or a woman spoken
about.

letter /Sra:'/   ,
     If the last later of the verb stem is an /i/ represented by the
                      ,   these changes occur:

Example:
     I go                 /nimshi/
     you go (m.)           /timshi/

      you go (f.)          /timshi/

      he goes              /yimshi/

      she goes             /timshi/

      we go                /nimshu/

      you go (pl.)         /timshu/

      they go              /yimshu/


      Note what has happened:
1.    you (f.) -     Since   the verb "stem" ends in /i/, there is no
                     need to add the /1/ that usually distinguishes you
                     (f.) from you (m.). This means that now you
                     (m.), you (f.), and she are all identical in form
                     and pronunciation. Context will tell you which is
                     intended.

2.    plurals        For all the plurals we, you, and they, the final/i/
                     is dropped and the /u/ which is the plural suffix
                     marker is added directly to the second letter of the
                     "stem" - in this case, the /shi:n/

      These are not random changes. All verbs with /i/ as /the last
letter of the "stem" behave like this model.

      Generally, asking questions in Hassaniya is indicated by tone of
voice and "rising intonation" -- you show  you are asking questions by
raising your voice at the end of the sentence.   In written Arabic, un-
less the question is introduced by a question word,  the only difference
between a statement and a question is the question mark.
     Here is a review of words that can be used to introduce questions
in Hassaniya:
1.   "Is it so?"             /ya:k ?/
2.   "What?"

    The Hassaniya for "what?" varies slightly in form depending on
whether a man, a woman, or a group is being addressedor referred to:
     "What?" (m.)            /shinhu ?/

     "What?" (f.)            /shinhi ?/

     "What?" (pl.)           /shinhum ?/


3.   "Who?"     "Which?"

     The Hassaniya for "who?" varies slightly in form depending   on
whether a man, a woman, or a group is being addressedor referred to:
     "Who?" (m.)            /minhu ?/
                                                       ylr'J.
     "Who?" (f.)            /minhi ?/

     "Who?" (pl.)           /minhum ?/

9. ' "How long ...?"
           The question "How long have you been         is formed in Hassaniya
           by /kam/ + /1/ or /11/ + relevant suffix pronoun.
           "How long have you (m.)      /kam 1-ak... ?/

      Although the patterns shown in Lesson 12 will apply to the vast
majority of verbs you will have     to use, there are two features you must
be aware of from the outset in learning Hassaniya:      1) a very few com-
mon verbs have an alternative prefix for the /y/ indicating        "he" and
"they"; 2) these same verbs usually dispense with
join the prefixes to the first letter of the verb stem. a "helper" vowel to

Example:
    I see                /nshu:v/

    you see (m.)         itshu:v/

    you see (f.)         /tshu : vi/

    he sees              /ishu:v/

    she sees             /tshu:v/

    you sec (pl.)       /tshu:vu/

     Three important verbs to           pay special attention to are the
following:
Example:     "want"
     I want              /ndu : r/

     you want (m.)       /iddu : r/

     you want (f .)      /iddu:ri/

     he wants            /idu:r/
                                                     ) 9 .)1
                                                           ---


     she wants           /iddu:r/

     we want             /ndu:ru/

     you want (pl.)      /iddu:ru/

     they want           /idu:ru/

Note that the /t/         prefix indicating "you" (m. ), "you" (f .) and
and "you" (pl.) is assimilated to the /d/ of the verb with an "upbeat
added at the beginning for more facility in pronunciation.
The /y/ of "he" and "they" is replaced by /1/.

     they can                  /igiddu/

    Note that in this verb the final letter of the "stem" is doubled if
followed by a vowel.

1.  There is no "infinitive" per se in Hassaniya. Therefore the sen-
tence "I want to go" is rendered in this way:

Examples:
            I want to go.
            indu:r nimshi/                                                                 ..., .., -.)
                                                              L.     r-`4:4-4-3




           (which translated literally means "I want I go".)

                     He wants to see Ahmad.
                     /idu:r ishu:v ahmad/           A.c1) \ j .......-:-' \ ./."-'\

            (literally "he wants he sees Ahmad".)

2.   The negative of Present Tense verbs is formed by putting /ma/L0
     before the verb.
Example:
            I don't want to go.
                                                               .                             .
            /ma ndu:r nimshi/                                                     ....)   ..k.)    is
                                                       cs.".....si

            She doesn't want to come.
            /ma iddu:r tji/

            We don't want to go.

                                  Lesson Sixteen




     The imperative (or "command" form) in Hassaniy? is formed in the
following ways:
     1.      When addressing any individual or group. simply put /I/ as
             an upbeat in front of the first letter of the verb "stem".
             When addressing a woman, /i:/ is also added after the last
             letter of the verb stem
     3.      When addressing a group of men or women. lu is added in-
             stead of   after the last letter of the verb stem.

      There is a special forth of the imperative for "come!" It is not re-
lated to the verb you !iavie learned meaning "to come".

     come! (m. & f.)               /wahay/
                                                                          U),
     come! (to a group)            /wahu/

Note that this form is only used as a command. "Come here!" is:
     /wahay ila:h/


Negative Imperative:
The negative of the imperative i.e. "Don't go", "Don't speak" is
formed in Hassaniya by putting the negative particle /1a/ in front of
the second person singular or plural (masculine or feminine where
relevant) of the verb:
Examples:
     Don't go!                     /la timshi/
     (to a man)
     Don't open the door!          /la tuvtahi il-ba:b/                           \
     (to a woman)

                           Lesson Seventeen




      Adjectives are placed after the noun in Hassaniya. Thus a phrase
like "a big house" literally translated from Hassaniya would be ''a house-
big" .

1.       Indefinite :
Masculine nouns take the masculine form cf the adjective :

Examples :

         a large room    /bayt

         a new book      /ikta :b ijdi:c1/                                  c--- L.-) 1



Feminine nouns take the feminine form of the adjective :

Examples :

         a big town      idashra ikbi: ra/                                             ..)

2.   Definite:
If the noun has the definite article "the ", /i1 /, the adjective followingi it
must also be prefixed by /ill. Thus the phrase "the big house" lit-
erally translated into Hassaniya would be "the house tlie big".

Examples:
     the large room        /il-bayt il-ikbi:r/                           _>)

Notes:
     1.     The rubs for joining thy: definite article Al/ to adjectives are
            identical to those for nouns.
     2.     Some nouns not ending   /ta:' marbu: t a/ are feminine.
            These nouns take the feminine endings witl- a following
            adjective.

Examples:

                              THE GENITIVE
                             Lesson Nineteen




    In Hassaniya phrases corresponding to the English' "the door of the
house" have the form of
           noun + article + noun
           (the door of the house)
           /ba:b id-da:r/                      /   1   .:..) \   c.... l.,

    Where the possessor is a person, the article is omitted. Thus a
phrase like "Mohammed's house" becomes
           /da:r muhammad/                                              ..)

           (house Mohammed)
In Hassaniya the "thing possessed" always precedes the "possessor".
There is no equivalent to the English " 's" to express possession.

If the first noun (that is, "the thing possessed") is feminine and ends
in a /ta:' marbu: to /, it is "opened" in pronuncation and pronounced
as a /ta:'/. This is only a pronunciation feature and in written
Arabic the /ta:' marbu: ta/ will always appear as a /ta:' marbu: ta/.
The transliteration, however, indicates this "opening".
Example:
           /wa: tat muhammad/
                                                                      _9

      You have already seen that the suffix pronouns, besides indicating
 possession, can also cover the equivalent of  the English "me", "you",
 "him", "her", etc. , which we have called
 saw the suffixed pronouns used in this sensethe object pronouns. You
                                                 with / and/ to give the
 equivalent in Hassaniya of "have/have got".
     These suffix pronouns can also be used with verbs as object pro-
 nouns to give us sentences like "I know him", "they know me", etc.
     Except for the fact that
/-ni/, all the other suffixes arewith verbs "me" changes from /-i/ to
                                  the same as you have alreadylearned.

Examples:
    They know me.                /yacrafu-ni/

    She knows you. (m.)          /tacraf-ak/

    He knows you. (f .)          /yacraf-ik/

    I know him.                  /nacraf-u/

    They know her.               /yacrafu-ha/

    She knows us.                /tacraf-na/

   They know you. (pl.)          /yacrafu-kum/

   I know them.                  /nacraf-hum/

     Only a few common verbs take the direct object in this way, e.g.
"to know", "to give", "to close",   "to open", "to
with your teacher which other verbs take the directspeak", etc. Discuss
                                                     object.
     Don't forget that in sentences like "I want you (m.) to come",
since there is no infinitive, the second verb must agree with the suffix
pronoun.
Examples:
     I want you (m.) to                                                _   <,

       come.                                                  ..5...       9 --3 -A-;
     He wants me to go.                  /idu:r-ni nimshi/

Further Use of Suffixes:
      The suffix pronouns used to denote "me", "you", "his",
etc. can also be, used with prepositions. The prepositioncyou will"her",
                                                                   prob-
ably use most frequently with the suffix pronouns is /ma a:/ t", "with".

Examples:
    with me                    c
                           /ma a:-ya/

    with you (m.)          /ma c a:-k/

    with you (f.)          /maca: -k/

                              c
    with him               /ma a:-h/

    with her               /ma ca:-ha/

    with us                   c
                           /ma a:-na/

    with you (pl.)         /mac a:-kum/

     Another preposition, /bi/               ,   (an alternative for "in") when
used together with the suffix pronouns gives the equivalent to "be-
cause" in Hassaniya:

Examples:
    because I                /bi: -ya/

    because you (m.)        /bi: -k/

    because you (f.)        /bi: -k/     .

    The Hassaniya equivalent for "to" or "for me" is /1/        or
/ill 31   plus the relevant suffix pronoun.                3
Examples:
    to me               /1-i/

                               Lesson Twenty-One




       The future is indicated in Hassaniya by placirig the invariable
word

                   /1a:hi/
in front of the verb. It corresponds in use exactly to "shall" or "will"
in English.
Examples:

       you'll go (m.)        fla:hi timshi/

    you'll go, (f.)          /1a:hi timshi/

    he'll go                 /1a:hi yimshi/

    Unlike the present tense, the future is made negative by using
/ma:ni/, /ma:nak /, /ma:nik/, etc.

Examples:
     I won't go           /ma:ni la:hi nimshi/

     he won't go          /ma:hu la:hi yimshi/

    we won't go           /ma:na la:hi nimshu/

    they won't go         /ma:um la:hi 'yimshu/


    Remember that in Arabic statements about the futureare generally
accompanied by the expression /in sha'alla:h/, ("if God wills it...").

                         THE ACTIVE PARTICIPLE
                           Lesson Twenty-Three




     As you have seen, the Present Tense in Hassaniya oftencovers
both the English Simple Present (used to describe habitual action)and
also the Present Continuous (used to describe what is happeningat the
time of speaking).
Examples:
     I sit here everyday. (habitual action)
     I am sitting now.       (describing what is happening at the
                              time of speaking)
     This applies    to most verbs, but with certain verbs describing
states of being and motion/action, if is possible to usea kind of adjec-
tive derived from the verb to describe what is happeningat the time of
speaking, overlapping in meaning with the Present Tense. We call this
adjective the "active participle" and it is formed by putting an /alif/
between the first and second letters of a three-letter verb stem.

  jp1 les: (Some of the most frequently used "active participles")
Examples
     going                /ma: shi/

    coming                /ja:i/

    knowing               /ca:rif/

     returning            /ra:jic/

     buying               /sha:ri/

     understanding        /fa:him/


     Since these "active participles" are really adjectives, they must
"agree" with whomever is speaking or being referred to male, female,
or a group of men or women.
    Thus      when   a   woman   is    speaking      or   being   referred to,
/ta:' marbu:ta/ must be added.
Examples:
    I understand.                     /ana fa.: hima/                 ;Le) L
    (woman talking)                                                            I:1

    When one of these "active participles" ends inan /i/, that final /i/
changes to /y/ when a suffix is added.

    The negative of the "active participle" is formed by putting
/ma:ni/ , /ma:nak/ , ma:nik/ , etc. in front of it.

Note
       The "active participle" does not always translate backinto, English
       as the Present Continuous and in many cases you coulduse either
       the Present Tense or the Active Participle with no difference in
       meaning. The only way you will really learn to use them is by
       listening to Mauritanians talking and by copying whatyou hear
       people around you saying.

                         THE INDIRECT OBJECT
                            Lesson Twenty-Four




     The indirect object such as in the phrase "to me" of "He gave it
to me", is expressed in Hassaniya by the preposition 1/4/1-/ or ill-I or
71.a-Tplus the relevant suffix pronoun. (For a paradigm of /1-/ see
Lesson 20 of The Grammar Handbook.)
     The following examples show' one verb ("give" in the past tense;
using all the relevant combinations of verb plus directobject (it) plus
indirect object. In this case the "it" is rendered masculine -don'tfor-
get that "it" will be either masculine or feminine depending on the gen-
der of the object being referred to.
Examples:
    you (m.) gave it (m.) to me           /catayt-u 1-i/

    we gave it (m.) to   y (f.)           /catana-u 1-ik/

     The past tei se in Hassaniya obeys a regular and predictable
pattern. The different persons are indicated by suffixes only added to
the last letter of the verb stem. These suffixes remain absolutely
constant from one verb to another.
     Here are three common verbs written out in all the iersons.
Examples:
1.   I wrote            /iatabt/

     you wrote (m.)     /katabt/

     As you can see, the suffixes indicating the differentpersons are
quite regular and predictable:

                        Verb Stem Suffix
        I                          t
        you (m.)
        you (f.)                   ti
        he
        she                       at
        we                        na
        you (pl.)                 to
        they

Note:

        The "he" form of the past tense is indicated by the verb stem
        standing alone. Since there is no infinitive in Arabic and the "he"
        form shows the basic stem of the verb, foreigners learning Arabic
        often refer to, verbs in this form. Thus we can speak of the verb
        /katab/ 3r Lraf when talking about the verb in its simplest or
        "infinitive" form.
        Note also that the only possible source of confusion may be that
        "I" and "you" (m.) are the same in pronunciation and writing.
        However. in conversation. context will tell you. which is intended.

4.   The negative of the Past Tense is formed by putting /ma/                             1.,
     before the verb.
Examples:
            I didn't speak.

                                                                                                '
                                                                                 ...le
            /ma tkallamt/                                               c.   ,.ak---)

            He didn't write this letter.
            i ma katab 1 -bra        ha                     1_,
                                                         _A,/                c......-Dr

5.   The suffix pronouns representing "me". "you". "him". "her". etc.
     can be added to the Past Tense verb in exactly the same way as
     with the Present Tense.
Example :

            I wrote it. (indicating a letter)
            'ana katabt-ha/




                   "In the Name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful"

    The following three examples are representative of verbs which
have a long vowel as one of their root letters.

1.   In verbs ending in /i:/ --:-.5 in the Present Tense, the /i/
     becomes either /ay/ or stays as /i:/ in the fitst and second persons
     singular and plural. This pronunciation varies from region to re-
     gion in Mauritania.

Examples:
     I went                /mashayt/    .

     These are not random changes       any verb with /wa:w/ ..9    as
the middle letter of the verb stem in the Present Tense will behave like
the above examples in the Past Tense.

     you (m.) sold       /bict/

     you (f.) sold       /bicti/

Past Tense of the Verb "To B 's" :
    Although Hassaniya does not have a verb "to be" in the Present
Tense, it is expressed in the past.
Examples:
     I was               /kint/

     you were (m.)       /kint/

     you were (f.)       /kinti/

     he was              /ka:n/

        When /ka:n/ cU U          is placed in front of /kha:lig/ or /cand/,
                5 it makes the equivalent of the Past Tense. /ka:n/
         remains constant throughout the       different personal pronouns.

    EIamples:

                THE COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE
                             Lesson Twenty-Eight




1.   The Comparative :
      The Comparative in Hassaniya is formed by dropping the vowel,
either the /i : / or /a : / (depending on the word) from adjectives. The
short vowel /i/ which occurs at the beginning of some adjectives is also
dropped. We might note here that this formula differs from Standard
Arabic in that in the latter, an /alit/ I carrying a /fatha/ i is placed
before the entire adjective, while at the same time shortening the middle
/a : / or /i:/. This creates a slight "upbeat" in the pronunciation, as in
the example /kibi: r/ -- /ukbir/. Be aware of both the Hassaniya and
the standard systems of forming the comparative.
Examples :

     hot       /ha :mi/                            hotter    /hma/

     big       /ikbi: r/                           bigger    /kbir/

    The comparative has only one form in Hassaniya for the masculine,
feminine and plural (m. and f.).
      All comparatives are followed by /min/             ,   which is equivalent
to "than" in English.

Examples:
     1.     This man is bigger than that man.
            /ha:dha it -ra:jil kbir min dlia:k it -ra:jil/



    2.      This is newer than that.

LESSON TWENTY-EIGHT                     THE COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE




2.   The Superlative
     The Superlative in Hassaniya also has only one form for the mas-
culine, feminine and plural (m. and f.).
     It is expressed by using 1) the definite article /1/ followed by an
unaltered adjective followed by 3) /minhum/              which is the equi-
valent to "among them" or "of all".

Examples:
     1.     He is the biggest (of them all).
            /huwa 1-ikbi: r minhum/




     2.     This is the newest (of all).

    In Hassaniya a continuous action in the Past is rendered by the
Past Tense of the verb "be". ika:nP (5 together with the Present
Tense:
Example:

Note:
        The subjects of the verbs must "agree". that is. if the subject is
        "he". both the verbs must be in the third person singular.

        The   following paradigm shows one            complete verb   in   all   the
persons:
        I was walking                'kint nimshi:

                                 Lesson Thirty




    Conditional sentences (i.e. sentences beginning w:,th "if") are
much more fluid in Arabic than in English. We have in English at least
three fixed, unchanging types of conditionals, but the same ideas of
condition are expressed in Arabic in one of two ways, with some over-
lapping.    The Hassaniya word for "if" is:
                                                      '
                      /illa/                      \
1.   Simple Conditional
     The Simple Conditional expressing future possibility can be ex-
pressed in Hassaniya by using the. ?resent Tense following "if", plus
either the Future /1a:hi/ + Pres.ent Tense, OR just the Present Tense
in the other part of the sentence.
Example :

     If you go, you (will) see him.
     /ilia timshi la:hi tshu:v-u/
                 OR
                                                          .
     /ilia timshi tshu : v-u/                                                                     91
                                                      P

                                                      4U,      ..,4ri4...)        L5-212



2.   Hypothetical Conditional
     The Hypothetical Conditional implying less certainty of what will
probably happen can be expressed by using the Past Tense after "if"
plus either the Future /1a:hi/ + Present Tense, OR the Past Tense in
the other part of the sentence.
Example:
     If you came, you (would) see him.
                                            , .
     /ilia jayt la:hi tshu:v-u/             c9                               _9    .....,...,4)

                 OR
     /llla jayt shivt-u/                                      ti:Alsi.J.0         Cd..u?

3.   Impossible or Unreal Conditional
     The Impossible or Unreal Conditional referring to an incomplete
action, or when expressing an unfulfilled wish, can,. be expresed by
the same construction as in example #2 above. Context determines the
interpretation of this sentence as either Hypothetical or Impossible.
    So that you can more easily see the formulas involved in these
constructions, here they are in a box:



               If-clause                            Main Clause

     1.       /ilia/ + Present               /1a:hi/ + Present
                                                  OR Present Only


     2.       /illa/ + Past                  /1a:hi/ + Present
                                                  OR Past only

The" following are lists of "minimal pairs", i.e. , pairs of words that are
exactly the same except for one letter. Thus, these words are very
similar in pronunciation. Go over these words with your teacher,
paying close attention to the differences. The difficult sounds in
Arabic take time to master - refer to these exercises often to practice
the new sounds.

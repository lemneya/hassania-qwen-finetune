Ḥassāniyya Arabic


1. GENERAL INFORMATION

Ḥassāniyya (or klām əl-Bīđ̣ān ‘language of the Whites’) is the mother tongue of the Arabic-
speaking population of the western Sahara, especially the Moors (Bīđ̣ān) of Mauretania and
the former Spanish Sahara (from the Sagya el-Ḥamra and the Rio del Oro). It is difficult to
draw the precise geographical limits of this dialect, but its approximate borders are
Goulimine in the north, Tindouf in the northeast, Tombouctou in the southeast and the
Senegal River in the south. The percentage of Ḥassāniyya speakers is highest in the central
regions. There are about 3 million speakers, around 2 million living in Mauretania, out of a
total estimated population of 2,9 million. By the middle of the 20th century, most speakers
still had a Bedouin lifestyle.
        The origin of the Ḥassāniyya is linked (as indicated by its name) to the arrival of the
Banū Ḥassān, a branch of the Maˁqil Arabs – who were themselves linked to the movements
of territorial expansion of the Banū Hilāl and the Banū Sulaym. Ḥassāniyya is a Bedouin
dialect that is part of the western dialect group (Maghrebi) and has developed in a Berber-
speaking environment. Despite the influence of the substrate and because of its Bedouin
nature, it has more in common with eastern Arabic dialects, most of which (though not all)
are Bedouin, than with Maghrebi dialects like Moroccan and Algerian.
        Ḥassāniyya is rarely used as a lingua franca, even if certain Black-African
Mauretanians are more or less proficient in it. It is not used as a means of written
communication; Literary Arabic (Classical or Standard) or a foreign language, in particular
French, are used for writing. An important oral literature exists, most of it poetry, but the
conditions that gave rise to this literature are rapidly changing (—> Mauretania).
        Ḥassāniyya has been studied extensively, but no recent manuals exist, except in
xeroxed form. A reference grammar was published by Cohen (1963). Although its subtitle is
‘Dialect of the Gabla’, it may be regarded as typical of the dialect variety that is spoken in
Mauretania as well as in the former Spanish Sahara. An overview of the grammar is given in
the introduction to Taine-Cheikh’s Ḥassāniyya/French dictionary (1988:I-CIII). For
grammatical details see Taine-Cheikh's articles, which appeared in particular in Materiaux
Arabes et Sudarabiques.
        Ḥassāniyya shows an exceptional unity, with a few exceptions. Genuine Ḥassāniyya
speakers, as well as unilingual or, more often, bilingual people speaking a variety that
differs from the standard dialect, can be found at the Moroccan, Malian, and probably
Algerian borders. The dialects of these speakers are so different that they are virtually
incomprehensible to the uninformed Ḥassāniyya speaker (Taine-Cheikh 1997; Heath 2002,
2004). Nowadays, this variation is largely individual, but formerly it was often linked to the
history of certain tribal groups, such as the Tekna of Morocco or the Brābīš and the Kunta of
Mali.
        In the 1970s, under the influence of Arab nationalist movements and in the context
of forced settlement, intellectuals and their students have developed a form of Arabic that
was a mix of dialect and Modern Standard Arabic, used in political discussions (Taine-
Cheikh 1978). This ‘middle’ Arabic has spread gradually, introducing many new words in
the traditionally very rural dialectal lexicon.

2. LINGUISTIC DESCRIPTION

Ḥassāniyya is a relatively conservative language (at least when compared to other Maghrebi
dialects) but it has also developed several innovations, in particular certain morphosyntactic
patterns (Taine-Cheikh 1991). The Berber substrate does not seem to have had a large
influence on the structure of Arabic. Its presence may be perceived in the lexicon, but since
most loanwords receive a special treatment, their influence is usually limited. Where
common forms exist between Ḥassāniyya and Mauretanian Berber (Zenaga), it is often hard
to attribute the source to either language. In several cases, a parallel development may have
taken place, facilitated by the remote genealogical relation between Arabic and Berber. This
development may have been furthered by the progressive disappearance of Zenaga and a
process of osmosis between Arabic- and Berber-speaking groups.

/ġ/ is attested only among certain speakers (mainly in the west, southwest and northwest)
when it is not geminated. /ġ/ and /q/ have merged, being realized as [q] by the other
Ḥassāniyya speakers (centre, east and northeast Mauretania, Mali and Algeria) and, by all,
in all case of gemination (/ġġ/ realised [qq] as in Zenaga).
        The phonological system is rich. Ḥassāniyya tends to phonemicize the opposition
emphatic/non-emphatic (especially for the vibrants, /ṛ/ being more frequent than /r/) and
to preserve the pronunciation of some of the borrowed lexemes, hence the presence of
phonemes from Classical Arabic (/ḍ/, /q/, or even //), Zenaga (/ẓ/, /dy/, /ty/, /ny/) and
even from Black African languages (/q/ and the palatalized consonants).



2
        Yet, certain phonemes remain marginal, especially in loanwords and the velarized ḅ,
ṃ, ṇ, ṿ). It is often difficult to find minimal pairs, except for l ~ ḷ, g~ q and above all r~ṛ:
dār/idīr ‘to put’ vs. dāṛ/idōṛ ‘to want’; gās ‘to go toward’ vs. qās ‘measure’; gām ‘to get up’ vs.
qām ‘to prepare the tea’; ḍall ‘to err [in religion]’ vs. đ̣all ‘to spend the day’; zanga ‘to skirt
around while going up’ vs. ẓanga ‘to make someone pay a tribute’; walla ‘to come back’ vs.
waḷḷa ‘or’; bəṛga ‘shacks’ vs. ḅəṛga ‘bad quality tea’; tamātāya ‘(a) gum tree’ vs. taṃātāya ‘(a)
tomato’.
        Even though the status of some phonemes is problematic (especially in the case of ṇ
and ṿ), this does not challenge the existence of emphasis (for an opposite position see
Zavadovskij 1981:26–27).

2.1.1.2 Historical remarks on the inventory
Ḥassāniyya is characterized by the realization of qāf as [g], the maintaining of the
interdentals (/đ̣/ being the reflex of most words with ḍād in Classical Arabic) and the
disappearance of the hamza (often compensated, at the end of the syllable, by lengthening
of the preceding vowel).

2.1.1.3 Phonetic realization
/j/ is realized as a palato-alveolar fricative [Z]. The labial spirant is realized preferentially
as a voiced consonant [v], except in contact with a voiceless consonant or when it is
geminate. This realization is particular to this dialect (with the exception of the Ḥassāniyya
of the Mali).

2.1.1.4 Distribution
The emphasis of the vibrant varies sometimes according to the context. Emphasis may be
lost or absent in the presence of /y/, /ī/ or even /ə/: ‘ašṛa ‘ten’, ˁəšrīn ‘twenty’, ˁāšər ‘to
count by tens’. More generally, the assimilation of sonority and emphasis — in particular for
/s/~/ṣ/, /z/~/ẓ/ — is frequent among the consonants, whether in contact or not: ‘rīs ‘bride
groom’, but ‘ṛūṣ ‘bride’. Extended to all the forms of the same root, this helps to explain
certain differences with Classical Arabic (sometimes common to other dialects), e.g. t-f-l:
dvəl ‘to spit’ (but in the east and in Mali: tfəl), q-t-l: ktəl ‘to kill’, ṣ-ġ-r: sġayyər ‘small’, ṣ--y:
ẓwä ‘to twitter’. There are also some conditioned alterations between sibilant and palato-
alveolar fricatives belonging to the same root (assimilation with loss of the palato-alveolar
fricative), thus n-s-ž: näzz ‘to weave’, ž-z-z: zäzz ‘to shear’.

2.1.1.5 Sociolinguistic variables
Some tendencies appear among the least educated groups, such as the marginalization of
/ḍ/; in the southwest, the merger of /q/ and /ġ/ and, only in a limited region, the tendency
to emphasize t in contact: [ṭṛa:b] ‘earth’.

2.1.2 Vowels
Table 2. Vowels

                opened syllable               closed syllable

/ū/             /u/
/ā/             /a/                           /a/




3
The merger of /i/ and /u/ in closed syllables is characteristic of the nomadic dialects
(Cohen 1970). The short phonemes /a/ and /ə/ are realized variably, according to context.
In a neutral context, /a/ undergoes ’imāla and is realized more centralized (transcribed ä).
Long vowels have variable length: long under the accent, average apart from the accent,
and short in final position. Final long vowels are lengthened again before a suffix: šāvu ‘they
have seen’, šāvū-h ‘they have seen him/her/it’. When /ā/ is realized as a short vowel, it
undergoes ’imāla: žä ‘he came’, žā-h ‘he came to him’.

2.1.3 Diphthongs
The four former diphthongs are preserved: /ay/, /aw/, /iy/, and /uw/. However, the
realization of /ay/ and /aw/ sometimes tends towards [e:] and [o:].

2.1.4 Syllable
Because of the general preference for closed syllables, short vowels in open syllables are
rare, apart from loanwords and in final position. They are found, however, in several initial
syllables in which the short syllable represents a first radical w/y (uvä ‘he is over') or plays
an important morphological role (aḥmaṛ ‘red’, ikättäb ‘he makes [them] write’, udägdäg ‘to
be broken’).
        The most frequent syllabic type is CVC and CVV, but syllables with double coda
CVCC or double-onset CCVC are frequent. Closed syllables with long vowels (CVVC) are
attested, especially in the participles, kātbīn ‘writing [pl.]’. Several open syllables have a
secondary origin (3rd radical w/y): žäru < žərw ‘young dog’ (fem. žərwä).

2.1.5 Consonant clusters
The general rule for consonant clusters is to introduce epenthetic vowels after elision of
short vowels in an open syllable, malḥafa > /malḥfa/ ‘veil (of the women)’ [realized
[mæləḥfæ]. In monosyllabic nouns, metathesis is regular, except in loans from Classical
Arabic: [ṭfəl] ‘boy’ (but [ṭəvl-u] ‘his boy’).

2.1.6 Stress
Stress is on the third mora from the end of the word, e.g., on the first syllable in mäktäb
‘desk’, on the second in mäktūb ‘written’. It is strongly marked only on long vowels (accent
of length rather than intensity). A lot of grammatical morphemes are clitics.

2.2 Morphology

2.2.1 Pronouns
The gender opposition is never marked in the 1st person.

2.2.1.1 Personal independent pronouns (Table 3)

2.2.1.2 Possessive/object suffixes (Table 4)
The clitic pronoun of the 1st person singular has two different forms, after a verb (šāv-ni ‘he
saw me’) or after a preposition (vī-yä ‘in me’) or noun (ktāb-i ‘my book’). In certain special
contexts (e.g., after mā- ‘not’, mən- ‘who?’), a short form of the independent pronoun is used
for the 3rd person singular: masc. -hu, fem. -hi. The possessive pronouns consist of a base
that varies according to gender in the singular (masc. līl- fem. līlt-; pl. lwāyl-) and of an affix
pronoun: līl-i ‘mine’.

    fem.                                                  -hä (-hā-)

2.2.1.4 Presentatives
The presentatives consist of an independent personal pronoun (in the sg,, short or long
form), preceded by a demonstrative or a particle with a verbal origin: ḏähu(wwä) ‘here',
ḏākhu(wwä) ‘there’, (a)ṛahu(wwä) ‘there he is’: ḏīkhi(yyä) maṛyäm ‘there is Mariem’.

2.2.1.5 Relative pronoun
The relative pronoun is invariable in gender and in number: lli (sometimes əl) ‘who, what’.

2.2.1.6 Interrogative pronouns
Interrogative pronouns include mən ‘who?’ (mən-hu ‘who is it?’); š(ə)- ‘what?’ and its
variants: -āš after a preposition; šən- in šən-hu ‘what is it?’; äyy (invariable) ‘which one?’
(äyy-kum ‘which one of you?’).

2.2.2 Adverbs
i.    Interrogative adverbs: mnäyn et wäyn ‘where?’, äyntä ‘when?’, kämm ‘how much?’, əˁl-
      āš ‘why?’, škīv ‘how?’.
ii.   Adverbs of place: hūn, hūnāti(yyä) ‘here’, vämm, vämmāti(yyä) ‘there’, hōwk,
      hōwkāti(yyä) ‘over there’, ilāh ‘toward there’, l-gäddām ‘in front of’, ət-taḥt ‘under’, əl-
      väwg ‘above’.

iii.   Adverbs of time : đ̣aṛk, đ̣aṛkāti(yyä) ‘now’, l-yäwm ‘today’, ġdä ‘tomorrow’, əṣ-ṣəbḥ
       ‘tomorrow morning’, yāməs ‘yesterday’, əl-bārəḥ ‘yesterday night’, əl-läylä ‘tonight’.
iv.    Adverbs of quantity: yāsər ‘a lot’, ḥattä ‘very’, šwäyy ‘little/few’.

2.2.3 Particles
The l of the definite articles əl- assimilates to all ‘sunletters’ and to ž. There is no indefinite
article and no particle of the genitive. The verbal negative form is mā in assertive sentences
(without a second element), lā with the imperative. In a nominal sentence, the negative
form is combined with the suffix pronouns (mā-ni, mā-n-ak, etc.).
i.     Prepositions: və (vī- + pronoun) ‘in’, ‘lä (əˁlī-) ‘on’, bə (bī-) ‘with’, mən ‘de’, ‘and ‘by’,
       šäwṛ ‘toward’, gäddām ‘in front of’, uṛa ‘behind, after’, sābəg ‘before’, taḥt 'under’, väwg
       ‘above’.
ii.    Subordinating conjunctions: ˁan, änn ‘that’, mnäyn ‘when’, bī(h)əlli ‘because’, äyyāk,
       bbāš ‘for’, ilā, iḏa ‘if’ (condition), (yä)kān ‘whether’ (indirect interrogation).
iii. Coordinating conjunctions : wə / u ‘and’, waḷḷa ‘or’, (ya)ġäyr/(ya)qäyr ‘but’.

2.2.4 Nouns
The singular feminine form of nouns and adjectives ends in -a(t) with a few exceptions such
as ˁanz ‘goat’, xādəm ‘woman slave’, ˁayn ‘eye’, dāṛ ‘house’, and xandūd ‘good milker’, ḥāməl
‘pregnant’ (but ḥāmlä ‘[who] wears’).
        Apart from the broken plurals there is an external plural: masculine -īn and feminine
-āt; there are some —> pseudo-duals such as uḏnäyn ‘ears, two ears’.
        Numerous Berber loanwords have special affixes: prefixes in a(a)-/i(i)- for
masculine, ta(a)-/ti(i)- for feminine nouns; suffixes -t for feminine singular and -ən for plural
nouns.
        The pattern C1aC2C2āC3 (nouns of habit, profession) is very frequent: käḏḏāb ‘liar’.
        Adjectives of color and defect: masc. sg. aCCaC, aḥmaṛ ‘red’, fem. sg. CaCCa, ḥamṛa,
comm. pl. CəCC, ḥəmṛ.
        aCCaC is also the pattern of the comparative form (invariable): akbaṛ ‘taller’, aḥmaṛ
‘more red’.
        The diminutive formation is very productive and very differentiated for nouns and
adjectives: CCayC kläyb (< kälb ‘dog’), CCayyəC ktäyyəb (< ktāb ‘book’), CCayCəC ˁgäyrəb
(<ˁagrəb ‘scorpion’), CCayCīC bzäyzīl (< bäzzūl ‘udder’), aCayCəC aḥaymər (< aḥmaṛ ‘red’).

2.2.5 Numerals
Cardinals 1 and 2 agree in gender: 1 masc. wāḥəd fem. waḥdä; 2 masc. äṯnäyn fem. ṯäntäyn.
The dual is still productive: kälb-äyn ‘two dogs’. Certain cardinals have two forms. From 3 to
10, the long form in -a is used in the absolute state.

The number 100 is miyyä in the absolute state and mīt in the construct state. The other
cardinals have an invariable form: 20 ˁəšrīn, 30 ṯlāṯīn, 40 aṛbˁīn, 50 xamsīn, 60 səttīn, 70
säbˁīn, 80 ṯmānyīn, 90 təsˁīn, 200 mītäyn, 1,000 älv.
         With the exception of äwwäl ‘first’, the ordinals have the pattern of the participle
fāˁəl: ṯāni ‘second’.

2.2.6 Verbs

2.2.6.1 Patterns/stems

2.2.6.1.1 Pattern I: 3-radicals
The stem vowels are /a/ or /ə/; there are 3 subclasses, the most frequent being that of verbs
with a harmony between the two vowels: type a: ktəb/yəktəb ‘to write’ (often root without
back consonant); type b: vtaḥ/yavtaḥ ‘to open’; type c (mixed): ṛgaṣ/yərgəṣ ‘to dance’.
       The diminutive form aC1ayC2aC3/yaC1ayC2aC3: äkäytäb/yäkäytäb ‘to write with a
bad handwriting’ is rare.

2.2.6.1.2 Pattern I : 4-radicals
This type is unique, with two stem vowels /a/: gaṛmaṣ/igaṛmaṣ ‘to pinch’. Particular cases
are: (R2=R4) baxbax ‘to burst out laughing’, (R3=R4) baḥšäš ‘to strangle’.

2.2.6.1.3 Derived patterns (Table 6)
The derived forms are numerous and productive. In many cases, there is a correlation
between active and reflexive (forms with/without t- or -t-) and a systematic relation
between active and passive (forms with/without n- or u-). The internal passive has
disappeared in Ḥassāniyya (as in most dialects), but a new system of formal oppositions has
developed to denote the distinction between middle/reflexive/reflexive-passive, on the one
hand, and a real passive form, on the other. Only form ‘XI’ (expressing a change of state) is
isolated in this system.
        The stem vowel of the derived forms is always that of the perfect of Form I. Form
VIII (rare as middle, əštġal ‘to work’) is used as passive of Form I if the first radical is l, m, n,
r, ṛ, w or an original hamza: (ə)rtdəm ‘to be buried’, (ə)ltˁan ‘to be cursed’. Form VII is the
regular passive of the theme I: (ə)nktəb ‘to be written’, ənvtaḥ ‘to be opened’.

          Form II is very frequent as causative-factitive and iterative of Form I or
denominative: gaṭṭaˁ ‘to have it cut; to cut in small pieces’, baṛṛag ‘to make it shine’. Form V
is frequent as middle or reflexive of Form II: tgaṭṭaˁ/yətgaṭṭaˁ ‘to cut itself in small pieces’; u-
II: ugaṭṭaˁ ‘to be cut in small pieces; to be made to go across’.
          Form III is quite frequent as extensive of Form I or causative-factitive of Form VI:
vārəg ‘to separate one from the other'. Form VI is frequent as reciprocal, middle or reflexive
of From III: tvārəg ‘to separate ourselves from one another’; u-III: uvārəg ‘to be separated
from one another’.
          Form ‘IV’ has some causatives-factitives of form X): saˁṛab ‘to arabize’, saḥmaṛ ‘to get
it reddish’. Form X is quite frequent as reflexive, middle, and inchoative: staˁṛab ‘to arabize
itself’, staḥmaṛ ‘to become reddish’.
          Form ‘XI’ is rare: gṣāṛ ‘to become short’.
          Examples of derived forms of quadriradical verbs are baˁṛaṣ ‘to fluster’, tbaˁṛaṣ ‘to
fluster oneself’, ubaˁṛaṣ ‘to be flustered’.

All derived verbs have a participial form in m- except VII and ‘XI’. The participles form their
plural form with the suffixes -īn and -āt. The suffix of the feminine (*-at) is in -a, except
before a direct object clitic pronoun: hiyyä šārbä ‘she drank’, hiyyä šārəbt-u ‘she drank it’.
        Elatives (invariable) exist for all participles, with an identical form for the forms
with/without t (Taine-Cheikh 1984:284-290): I (vāhəm) äfhäm mən ‘understanding better


9
than’; VIII (məštmaṛ) äšmaṛ mən ‘demonstrating more courage than’; II/V (mˁalläm,
mətˁalläm) äˁalläm mən ‘teaching/studying better than’; III/VI (mvārəg, mətvārəg) ävārəg mən
‘separating (themselves) from one another better than’; ‘IV'/X (msaˁṛab, məstaˁṛab) äsaˁṛab
mən ‘arabizing (oneself) more than’; quadriradicals (I and with t-) (mbaˁṛaṣ, mətbaˁṛaṣ)
abaˁṛaṣ mən ‘flustering (oneself) more than’.

2.2.6.4 Verbal nouns
With the exception of Form ‘XI’, verbal nouns usually exist for all verbs with a non-passive
meaning. The forms vary for I (long or short vowel): vähm ‘understanding’, ḥsāb ‘act of
counting’, ġrīg ‘act of sinking’, rsūl ‘act of sending’. One form prevails for all other cases,
often common to verbs with/without t: II/V təC1C2āC3, təbṛāg ‘act of making something
shine’; III/VI tC1āC2īC3, tvārīg ‘mutual separation; act of separating from one another’;
‘IV’/X staC1C2īC3, staˁrīb ‘arabization, act of arabizing oneself’; quadriradicals (I and with
t-) tC1aC2C3īC4, tbaḥšīš ‘strangling, the fact of strangling (oneself)’.
         The instance noun is generally in -a. It may be accompanied by a pattern change for
I (räslä ‘(a) sending’) and regularly so for II/V: təC1C2īC3a, təbṛīgä ‘act of making something
shine once’.

The derived verbs are generally well attested.
i.    Geminated verbs: Derived forms include Forms III and VI: sātt/isātt ‘to put per sixes’;
      tmāss mˁa ‘to adjoin something’; X: with a joint form stäxaff ‘not to take something
      seriously’ or disjunctive stägläl ‘regard as rare’.
ii.   I alif: In integrated borrowings from Classical Arabic, the first radical of this verbs is
      represented by ā : āḏən əl ‘to authorize’; X: stāxaṛ ‘to move back’.
iii.  I w/y: Form VIII has a passive meaning: ūtzən yūtzən ‘to be weighed’.
iv.   II w/y: The alternation ā~ə attested in the perfect of Form I likewise occurs in the
      derived forms VII, VIII and IX; VIII: ḥtāl ‘he was crafty’, ḥtəlt ‘I was crafty’; Form X:
      with ā, stävād ‘to take advantage of’; with w or y, stälyän ‘to become suppler’.
v.    III w/y: The vowel of the 3rd person sg. is always /ā/ in the perfect. In the imperfect
      /ī/ is used in forms II, III, ‘IV’ and single quadriradicals verbs; /ā/ is used in forms V,
      VI, VII, VIII, X, quadriradicals verbs with t- and all the u-forms.
vi.   Irregular verbs: There are two verbs with ‘mixed’ conjugation (perfect of II w,
      imperfect of I w) kāl yäwkäl ‘to eat’, participles wākəl and mäwkūl, and xāđ̣/yäwxađ̣
      ‘to get out’. žä/iži ‘to go’, participle žāy.

2.3 Syntax

The syntax of the dialect shows only a few specificities when compared with the other
Bedouin dialects of the Maghreb.

2.3.1 Noun phrase
The main characteristic of the noun phrase is the preservation of the synthetic construction.

2.3.1.1 Expression of definiteness and indefiniteness
The presence/absence of the definite article əl marks definiteness, except in the construct
state and with certain masculine nouns borrowed from Berber (generally beginning with
a(a)- or i(i)-): kälb ‘(a) dog’ ~ əl-kälb ‘the dog’, ävūk ‘(a ~ the) veal’.
        The demonstrative generally precedes the noun, which is always determined: ḏīk-əd-
dāṛ ‘this house’. Sometimes, it follows the noun, especially with proper nouns: ṭəvl aḥmäd
ḏāk ‘this son of Ahmad’, ‘the son of this Ahmad’. There is no indefinite article. The partitive
is expressed with mən ‘of’: wāḥəd mən lə-ktūb ‘one of the books’, ktāb mən lə-ktūb ‘any of the
books’.

2.3.1.2 Construct state
Possession is expressed by the construct state: ktāb əṭ-ṭfəl ‘the book of the boy’, ktāb-u ‘his
book’. There is no genitive particle in Ḥassāniyya, except, infrequently, in Morocco: dyāl
(Taine-cheikh 1999:98-99), ntāˁ (Heath 2002:7).

2.3.1.3 Numeral phrase
If the counted noun is indetermined, the numerals (from 3 upward) are always constructed
as nouns in annexion: ˁašrīn žmäl ‘twenty camels’. The form used is the one of the construct
state: from 3 to 10 short and/or contracted (axməs äklāb ‘five dogs'’; with a -t suffix before
some masculine forms with an original hamza, axməs-t äyyām ‘five days’); from 11 to 19
long with -əṛ (axməsṭaˁšəṛ ktāb ‘fifteen books’).
        If the counted noun is determined, the numeral is constructed as an adjective
(invariable in gender from 2 upward): l-äklāb l-äṯnäyn ‘the two dogs’, ktūb aḥmäd əl-ˁašrīn
‘the twenty books of Ahmed’, žmāl-u l-miyyä ‘his hundred camels’. The form used is the one

11
of the absolute state: from 3 to 10 long in -a (l-äklāb l-xamsä ‘the five dogs’); from 11 to 19
short without -əṛ (lə-ktūb l-axməsṭaˁš ‘the fifteen books’).

2.3.1.4 Adjectives phrases
The order is noun+adjective. Adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they
determine: ṛāžəl msäggäm ‘(a) fair man’, ṛažžālä msäggmīn ‘(some) fair men’, mṛa msäggmä
‘(a) fair woman’, ‘läy(y)āt msäggmāt ‘(some) fair women’. They are preceded by the definite
article when the noun is determined, ən-nāgä l-bäyđ̣a ‘the white female camel’, nyāg aḥmäd
əl-bīđ̣ ‘the white female camels of Ahmad’, or when it is highly referential, maṛyäm əš-
šäybāniyyä ‘Maryem, the old woman’.

2.3.1.5 Elative constructions
Followed by mən (introducing the second term of the comparison), the elative expresses the
comparative: äkbaṛ mən xū-h ‘taller than his brother’. Followed by a determined noun (or
pronoun), it expresses the relative superlative: äkbaṛ-hum ‘the taller among them’, äkbaṛ əṭ-
ṭavilāt ‘the taller of the girls’. When it is definite, it expresses the absolute superlative: l-
äkbaṛ ‘the tallest’, lə-mṛa l-äkbaṛ ‘the tallest woman’.

2.3.1.6. Relative clauses
The relative pronoun does not appear with an undetermined antecedent: mšä mˁa ḥadd mā
gaṭṭ šəfnā-h ‘he is gone with someone we have never seen’, but mšä mˁa əṛ-ṛāžəl lli vətnä šəfnä
‘he is gone with the man we had already seen’. Note the absence of the referential pronoun
in relative clauses with lli.

2.3.2 Verbal phrase
The direct object precedes the indirect object, which is introduced by əl: əˁṭa žmäl l-xāl-u ‘he
gave a camel to his maternal uncle’, əˁṭā-h l-u ‘he gave it to him’. However, the indirect
object is expressed without əl when it is the only suffix: əˁṭā-h žmäl ‘he gave him a camel’.

2.3.3 Verbal aspect: Time and tense
Innovations are very limited. There is no indicative prefix.

2.3.3.1 Future intent prefixes
The predicted future is expressed with the invariable particle lāhi (+ imperfect) which
corresponds etymologically to the participle of lhä ‘to keep oneself busy doing something’:
lāhi ngīs nwākšōṭ əš-šhaṛ əd-dāxəl (in-šā-aḷḷāh!) ‘I’ll go to Nouakchott next (God willing!)’.
Combined with past modality (perfect of kān ‘to be’), lāhi express the future in the past, kənt
lāhi ngīs nwākšōṭ mnäyn ˁədt mäwžūˁ 'I was about to go to when I fall ill’. The imperfect of
dāṛ (verb of desire) is also used, especially for the intended future: ndōṛ nəmši ‘I am going
(willing) to leave’.

2.3.3.2 Use of active participle
In its predicative use, the active participle has the meaning of a concomitant action.
Depending on the verb, it expresses a concomitant action in the unaccomplished [=
progressive present or past] (huwwä ṭāləˁ əl-kədyä ‘he is going up the mountain’, hiyyä kānət
ṭālˁa əl-kədyä ‘she was going up the mountain’) or in the accomplished [= resultative
perfect] (huwwä mətġaddi ‘he had lunch’ [=he is not hungry anymore]). The participle is
sometimes used for an imminent action, as if the agent was already engaged in the action:
ānä māši (ṣ-ṣəbḥ) ‘I am going (tomorrow)’.

2.3.3.3 Negation
The usual negative form is mā, but lā is used in several cases: for prohibitions, with the
imperfect (lā təbki! ‘don’t cry!’); after the coordinator wə/u ‘and’ (mā žä u lā ktəb ‘he didn’t
come and he didn’t write’; for a negative wish, with the perfect, in some expressions (lā
qərzu nyāg-hum! ‘I wish the milk of your camels doesn’t dry up!’); sometimes, as an
‘expletive’ negation after xāf ‘to fear’.
        The negation is not discontinuous but the affix pronoun appears regularly in the
absence of a conjugated verbal form (non-verbal predicate or presence of lāhi): mān-ak
gaṛṛāy ‘you are not a teacher’, mā-ni xāyəv ‘I am not afraid’, (aḥmäd) mā-hu lāhi yəbki
‘(Ahmad) he won’t cry’.

2.3.4 Word order SVO, VSO
In the absence of thematization, the order of the verbal sentence is VSO. This is the only
possible order if the subject is totally undetermined (Taine-Cheikh 1998). The interrogatives
mən ‘who?’ and əš ‘what?’ come at the beginning of the sentence.

2.3.5 Existential sentences
The dialect has several ‘pseudo-verbs’ consisting of a preposition and an affix pronoun, in
particular ˁand- (possession, hence ‘to have’), l- (attribution and alienable possession), mˁa-
‘with’, vī- (location). The order is VO (SVO with a thematized ‘subject’ noun) and the
negative form is mā: (ˁayšä) mā ˁand-hä vađ̣đa   ̣ ‘(Aïsha) she doesn’t have money’. The present
participle of xləg ‘to exist’ expresses existence: (mā-zāl) xāləg mbūṛu ‘there is (still) bread’.

3. LEXICON

The Ḥassāniyya lexicon is rich and well-structured around a relatively limited number of
high frequency schemes (cf. Taine-Cheikh, Dictionnaire Ḥassāniyya-Français, 1988-...). It
seems to have always had a tendency to enrich itself, either through borrowings (from
Berber, closely related African languages, Literary Arabic, French, etc.) or through internal
development. However the majority of the lexicon, at least 80% of the lexical items and
maybe 90% of the roots (if one only takes into account those who correspond to families of
names), is still of an Arabic origin. A quite important part of this vocabulary is more or less
characteristic of the Maghrebi dialects, especially of the Bedouin type, e.g. ˁatrûs ‘goat’, bġa
‘to desire’, gḏəv ‘to vomit’ or yāməs ‘yesterday’.
        The Arabic core is very stable and can be found, for its essential parts, across the
whole Ḥassāniyya-speaking area. Borrowings, calques, neologisms, semantic shifts and other
innovations are often less stable and more localized (for the eastern region, cf. the lexicons
of Pierret 1948 and Heath 2004). The history of those forms, hard to reconstruct, is often
more autochthonous than it seems. The Ḥassāniyya dialect has certainly borrowed more to
the Berber (especially the Zenaga) than to any other non-Arabic language, but many
creations seem to have appeared, if not first in Ḥassāniyya, at least simultaneously in
Ḥassāniyya and in Zenaga. Indeed, they are often absent from the Berber and Arabic
lexicons.

                       Preface To The Learner

An Introduction to Language Learning
      Congratulations to all of you who read this. First, con-
gratulations for your acceptance into Peace Corps and second,
congratulations for just performing a very complex act        read-
ing a language. Of course, the language is English and that
hardly seems like such a major accomplishment; after all, prac-
tically everybody you know can do it. For most of us, using
English is like breathing, an involuntary activity, or if we con-
sider it a skill, a skill that has become so natural to us that we
have taken for granted the fact that it represents the major in-
tellectual achievement of our lifetimes.
      The point, of course, is not that the learning of English is
in itself an especially significant accomplishment, but that the
learning of a language in either or both its spoken and written
forms is the great accomplishment. By being born as human
beings we may be programmed .to learn language just as we are
programmed to walk on only two legs but despite our human in-
heritance, learning a language still requires time and energy.
We don't just happen to learn a language; we do have to work
at it, and other people -- chiefly our parents, siblings and
playmates -- have to be willing to help.
     Although you may no longer have memories of your early
struggles to learn English, you can still appreciate the com-
plexity of the accomplishment by considering this: Assume for
the moment that you are about to siert a language training pro-
gram that will occupy you 12-14 hours a day, 7 days a week
for the next 3 to 5 years. without a break. At the end of
your training program you will still not be able to understand
radio programs of easily follow d conversation between two
adults and practical!; all books will still seem to be filled with
undecipherable squiggles. In f Ict, your knowledge of the writ-
ten language will be so minimal that you w ill now have to enroll
in a formal school for a considerable length of time and even
after several years of formal schooling you will still be develop- ...undecipherable sluilles..
ing your language skills by learning new words, polishing your
writing style and trying to read better. That is the sort of
language program you enrolled in when you began to learn your
native language, English.




                                                  L)
                                                                  Hosted for free on livelingua.com
                                  All this is not intended to frighten you about the language
                             learning task that lies ahead because learning a second lan-
                             guage is going to be easier. Most of you have already en-
                             countered a second language and unless that encounter came
                             early in your life while you were still very actively learning
                             your first language, the second encounter was an encounter of
                             a different kind. Some of you may have learned French or
                             Spanish and learned it reasonably well in high school, while
                             others have not had very successful experiences the second
                             time around. Now, as an adult you are being asked to learn a
                             new, second language.    Learning a second language is no small
                             task, but neither is it a matter of starting from scratch, as you
                             did when you learned English. So before you take your first
                             steps in your new language, we ask you to take the time to do
                             two things: try to understand the nature of the task ahead of
                             you and try to assess the personal strengths and weaknesses
                             that you bring with you as you start your assignment.
                                  What do you have to do to learn a new language? As you
                             might expect, the answers to this question are as numerous and
                             varied as people are and no two learners' strategies will be ex-
                             actly the same. This is so important to remember, let's say it
                             again in a different way: we can make many generalizations
                             about the way people learn language, but you are unique and
                             you can only learn in the way that suits you best, not in the
                             way an idealized, generalized member of your species learns.
                                   We have already said that learning a second language is
                             going to be easier. It is going to be faster, too, because you
                             already know a language and you will not have to re-invent
                             one. To be sure, the language you are going to learn is very
                             different from English and you n ay wonder just how much help
                             your English is going to be. It would be easier, for example,
                             if there were more cognates such as between English and the
                             Germanic or Romance languages, but you already know a lot
                             about languages and English in particular, and you can use
                             that knowledge. You already know, for example, that lan-
                             guages have a two-part structure (subject and predicate) and
                             you already know a great deal about what you can and cannot

students. If each of us were to draw a language profile of our-
selves we would find that our profiles, just like our per-
sonalities are different; strong and sharp in some areas, weak
and ill-defined in others. The point, however, is not how
strong or weak you may be -- or how fast or slow you may be
at learning languages -- but rather that you should examine
your own profile, find out where you are strong and weak and
use that information to capitalize on your strengths and try to
accept and even improve on your weaknesses. To help you be-
gin your self-assessment as a language learner, we suggest you
give some thought to the following aspects of language learning.
       Memorizing.    Are you good at memorizing? Obviously,
 learning a new language requires much more than memorizing a
 dictionary of that language, but having a good memory will
 help. The chief way in which it helps of course is in learning                      ,,---74
new words and phrases so that the right ones come quickly and
easily tc mind when you need them. When you store something
 in your mind for later use, put a "tag" on it; relate it to some-
thing that is already stored and accessible. When you first en-
counter a new word, explore it: hear it, say it, see it, feel
it. Re-cycle your collection. In language learning, using a                                     !.*1
new expression once is usually not enough. And don't be dis-                     taste. it if you can
couraged if you forget things. Your mind can only handle so
much at once and sometimes unused stuff gets thrown out to
make room for new things, but even the forgotten words have
probably left a trace so that the second time you learn them
they may stay longer        .

                                                 from Eng-
lish.   It may have words that do not translate easily into Eng-
lish and some English words and concepts may not have direct
equivalents with the new language. Try to remember that
English is only a language and your new language is a language
in its own right.
        Taking risks.           Inevitably, you will make plenty of mis-
takes, and adults do not like to make mistakes, especially in
front of other adults. But learning a new language is as much
a process of learning what not to say as it is learning what to
say.  You will have to develop some willingness to go out on a
limb and try things and not be upset if the limb breaks.
        Being relaxed. Trying too hard, and wanting too much to
succeed -- T'preing," as athletes say -- can be a serious pro- ...so cut on a. lank

                                  get at it and this is especially true of learning a new skill such
                                  as a language. Obviously, one way in which you can get a lot
                                  of practice is by taking a full and active part in the classroom.
                                  But there are other people in the classroom too, and everybody
                                  can't speak at once. However, you can talk to yourself, both
                                  in the classroom and opt. Subvocalization can be a very useful
                                  learning technique.

                                  skill and it's hard to listen when you're talking.But you can
                                  mouth somebody else's words and learn from their mistakes and
                                  successes as you listen.
                                       Analyzing the new language. Being open and receptive to
                                  the new language wilrget you to first base, but you'll stand a
                                  better chance of getting to second (and eventually scoring) if
                                  you understand the rules of the game. Linguists make their
                                  money by analyzing chunks of language to discover the rules.
                                  You don't have to become a professional linguist to learn a lan-

                            perspective. You don't have to sell your soul to the new cul-

                                  at you simultaneously and can be overwhelming. There are text

books and tapes containing things you ought to know. In th,
classroom there are memorization activities, drills, role - plays,
free expression and a lot of people listening and watching what
you do. Obviously you can't cope with everything simultaneous-
ly, and although this language course attempts to present the
language in an orderly fashion and although part of your teach-
er's job is to minimize the confusion, you have to get yourself
together too. Although much of your in-class time will be or-
ganized by the teacher and the material, you are the person
who has the responsibility for organizing your out-of-class
time.

      Understanding and acce tin your limitations. So far we
have pointed out several t ings to consider as you and your
new language confront each other. Learning a new language
also involves a certain amount of self - confrontation. You are
going to experience successes and failures, excitement and fa-
tigue and countless other emotions. You may have to question
your self-image as you compare your progress with your peers
and you may seem to come off unfavorably so let us say again             ...self- confrootation..
that you can only capitalize on your strengths, understand and
try to improve your weaknesses and be willing to accept results
that may not measure up to your aspirations.
        (;coperating and su   ortin .   Much of your schooling up
to this point mayTave een in an atmosphere that was com-
petitive. But in your struggle to learn a new language along
with your peers, all those learning skills that helped you pass
exams or write acceptable term papers won't be especially help-
ful in your new learning situation. You are all in the same
boat together, and although some people may row faster or
ha, der than you can, you'll go farther and longer as a team.
Learning to help and De helped will create an atmosphere in the
classroom that will make learning an enjoyable and unforgettable
communal experience. And remember too that using a language
is a social activity.  It takes one to speak and another to
listen, whether you're learning the language or using it in
fluent conversation.
      Now that we have asked you to think about language learn-
ing and yourself as a language learner, here's another F..agges-
don that will be well worth the time you put into It. Periodical-
ly, issue yourself a "report card" using the topics we have dis-
cussed (we have provided a fcrm on the next page) Beside.

each topic write a few remarks about how you think you're
doing. Do reports at least at the end of the first, third and
fifth week of training. We also recommend that you look over
the communication objectives in Appendix B to get some idea of
what you should be able to do in order to become a functional
speaker of Hassaniya   .

                          INTRODUCTION TO
                  THE LANGUAGES OF MAURITANIA


      The national language of Mauritania in Arabic. The Arabic used in
written materials - newspapers, magazines, books etc, is Classical
Arabic (often called Modern Literary Arabic or Modern Standard
Arabic), which is the official language all over the Arab world.
Classical Arabic is also used in formal spoken contexts, for example in
radio and T.V. braodcasts, political speeches and religious functions.
However in informal everyday spoken communication the national dialect
called Hassaniya is used. This is prima-ily a spoken, unwritten form of
Arabic derived from the Classical language, displaying pronunciation,
lexical and structural differences which distinguish it not only from
Classical Arabic, but also from the other spoken dialects of Arabic
found in other parts of the Arabic-speaking world. It is very im-
portant in the early stages of learning Arabic to be aware of the
existence, side by side, of what in effect can be regarded as two
languages: one "classical", literary, long-established written language
used as the medium of secular and religious literature which is rarely
spoken; the other a spoken language used for everyday verbal
communication which is not written.
     The name Hassaniya comes from the name of the Yemeni bedouin
tribes called Beni Hassan who invaded North Africa and settled in what
today is called Mauritania in the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries.
Hassaniya does not appear to be closely related to the dialects of North
Africa, probably because the Yemeni invaders of the south-western
Sahara remained relatively isolated from the people of the northern
Sahara.
    Hassaniya is spoken by the majority of the population of
Mauritania. Some Berber dialects exist in the northern parts of the
country, while in the south and south-west several African languages,
notably Toucouleur, Soninke, Wolof and Bambera are spoken.
     There is considerable linguistic diversity in Hassaniya. There are
four main sub-dialects,      Northern, Southern, Western and Eastern
Hassaniya, and also slight variations between urban, rural and nomadic
peoples. However these local variations within Hassaniya are mainly
limited to vocabulary and pronunciation variants rather than any sig-
nificant structural differences.




                                                                    1

      Education and foreign contacts (notably the French colonial in-
 fluence) have further increased the linguistic diversity within
 liassaniya. Many educated speakers of Hassaniya supplement their
spoken dialect with words and expressions borrowed from French and
Classical Arabic. This tendency is more marked in Nouakchott, the
larger towns and urban areas than in rural areas. Further loan words
have been borrowed from Berber and the various African languages
found in the southern areas of the country. While learning Hassaniya
you must always bear these geographical variations in mind, as well as
the influences from the languages which were current in the area before
the arrival of the Arabs and Islam.

Variant pronunciations of some of the letters of the Arabic alpilabet in
Hassaniya.
     The pronunciation outlined in this Literacy Handbook is based on
Classical Arabic, and would be understood not only in Mauritania, but
all over the Arabic speaking world. However, Hassaniya, like other
national Arabic dialects has its local peculiarities in pronunciation when
compared with the Classical Arabic pronunciation. These variations are
pointed out for your recognition. but not necessarily     Ex reproduction.
There is a prevalent attitude among the intellectual "elite" that these
variations are in some way "inferior."
The main features of Hassaniya are:
                                  we

1.           /ghayn/ becomes              /qa:f/. Thus a Hassaniya speaker
     would pronounce the word          Zi as /luqa/, or the, word              3431-2..)
     as /nuqsul/, or yoz-A-0 as /sqir/. It must be stressed that this
     is only a pronunciation variaticn; in writing the       /ghayn/
     will always appear written as a       L /ghayn/ by educated people.
2.             /qa:f/ is often pronounced as a              /ghayn/. Thus,
     a Hassaniya speaker would pronounce. the word                    as
                        , .                                  rk3
     /ghalam/, or    c-6, AP as imaghra:j/.       It must be st- ssed that
     this is only a pronunciation variation; in writing the         c.,
     /qa:f/ will always appear written as a                  /qa:f/.

3.   In most dialects of Hassaniya                        /qa:f/ is pronounced as
     /g /, as in "good."             Thus, you may hear the word c-1-49                    pro-
     nounced as /galb/, or                   V as /gu:li/ oras /ngid/.
     This is only a pronunciation variation, and in writing, the /qa:f/
     will usually appear written as a                     /qa:f/. You may see the
     /qa:f/ written this way, however:                               It is important to
     note that the two shifts                       /ghayn/ to        3          /qa:f/ and
                  /qa:f/ to                     /ghayn/ never combine to produce
     'the double transition of           f       /ghayn/ to /qa:f/ to /g/          .




4.   Generally,                    /fa:'/ is pronounced as /v/.
                                                             ,/             Thus a Has-
                                                                 O


     saniya speaker would pronounce the word                 Lj.,.).." as /varansa/.
     Again, it must be stressed that this is only a pronunciation varia-
     tion; in writing the                    /fa:'/ will appear written as a
     /fa:'/. or sometimes with the dot below:                          This variation is
     a unique feature of Hassaniya; the sound /v/ does not occur in
     the Arabic alphabet.

5.   Generally, Hassaniya speakers distinguish between                                 /dha:'/
     and    0,0         /da:d/; however, there are rare occasions when you
     will hear                 /dha:'/ used in the place of              (.);'         /da:d/,
     for example,       (15.1/4)1,.;0'   /id-da:lf:n/ will be pronounced as
     dha:li:n/. This is only a pronunciation variation, and in written
     Arabic a    Jo     /dha:'/ will always appear as a   1;   /dha:'/
     and the
     /da:d /.
                    ,             /da:d/ will always appear written as a


This is a feature you must listen out for; the cardinal rule is always to
pronounce words as you hear them pronounced by Mauritanians, taking
their pronunciation as correct in the context of their own dialect.

                                                                                ,
     native speaker of Hassaniya would pronounce the word ;:i,; Le as
     /dhama:niya/, or j t; as /dha:ni/.           Remember, this is a
     feature of the spoken language, and in written Arabic, the /tha:'/
                                ,
     is always written as ' /tha:'/.
7.   Generally, the                 /ji:m/ becomes /j/ in Hassaniya, similiar
     to the French pronunciation of 'j' as in "je".



 You may well hear all or only some of these shifts and variations de-
 pending on where you are living in the country. In Nouakchott and
 the larger towns you may hear all of them since the cities are the
 meeting places, and people using different local dialects live side by
 side. To most Mauritanians these shifts are mutually intelligible, but
 for a first time learner of Hassaniya they may appear a little daunting
 at first. However, keep your ears open and imitate what you hear
 used around you by native speakers and gradually these variations will
 fit into place. The important thing to always bear in mind is that they
 are all pronunciation variations; written Arabic will always follow the
 spelling of the word in Classical Arabic.

                               INTRODUCTION TO
            THE COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE HANDBOOK:

                        Parts of a Typical Lesson

     The Communication and Culture Handbook is a set of lessons that
concentrates on what to say and do in a variety of situations. These
situations are arranged in a sequence of 25 situations. Although it is
best to study them one after the other, it is possible to skip a lesson
or jump around in the book. It would be a good idea to cover all the
situations during the training program. The material has been designed
so that every student will have an opportunity to learn to say and do
something in every situation.
    You will notice that some of the lessons are divided into Basic
Material and Additional Material. Some students will learn faster than
others, and so they will be able to do additional work by learning the
Additional Material as well. The important thing to remember is that
the Basic Material is required and the Additional or Supplementary
Material is advised.
     Although each lesson is a little different from all the others. there
are usually six parts to each lesson. They are:
                          1.     Objective
                          2.     Basic Material
                          3.     Notes on basic material
                          4.     Activities
                          5.     Suggestions for Use
                          6.     Additional Material
     Teacher and students should be aware that not all the material has
been translated into Arabic. The second and third pages of most les-
sons contain the Arabic material as well as pertinent notes and sug-
gestions.   Since the students have activities and suggestions written in
their lessons, have the students suggest ways a lesson can be taught.
or -role-played.

Parts of a lesson:
1.         Objective. This is a statement of what you the learner is ex-
     pected to learn. It should answer the question "What new thing
     can I do as a result of learning this lesson?" Sometimes the title
     of the lessons will clearly indicate what the objective is, but some-
     times the title is inadequate, and reading the objective will be
     helpful. One thing that you should always ask yourself is "When
     this lesson is done, can I actually do what the objective says I can
     do." For a list of over-all objectives, see Appendix B.

2.        Basic Material and Translation. You will notice that the basic
     material is presented in English translation on the first, of
     left-hand page. The Arabic script version of the Basic Material
     (plus appropriate notes to the teacher) is available on the facing
     right-hand, or second page. The same material is available in
     Arabic script on the third page as well, opposite the transliterated
     version (with appropriate notes to the student) on the fourth
     page. Take the time now to thumb through a sample lesson of The
     Communication and Culture Handbook to observe this lay-out.

          The Basic Material is the heart of the lesson. It may be pre-
     sented in several ways. Sometimes it may be a dialogue; sometimes
     it may be a paragraph; sometimes it may be only key words and
     phrases. The Teacher's Handbook describes various techniques
     that you can use for teaching dialogues and other ways in which
     the Basic Material has been presented.
          For many of the lessons your job will be to memorize the
     words, phrases and sentences of the Basic Material. Memorization
     will require a certain amount rif repetition -- saying things over
     and over. This is not always very fun or interesting, but it is
     important, although there can be too much repetition too. Some of
     the material will require you to "play" with the language. Try to
     create new sentences based on words and sentence patterns you
     already know. Try to vary the phrases you have memorized, al-
     though many times you will make wrong guesses. You should not
     be discouraged from attempts to be creative with the language.
     Making mistakes is a very important part of language learning.

3.        Notes on Basic Material. The purpose of these notes in the                     .
     students' handbook is to explain given vocabulary items or new
     words which are contained in the dialogue or narrative material.
     Sometimes synonyms of the word are given.       Read both the English
     translation on the first page of the lesson and the English Notes
     below the transliteration in order to understand what you are
     being asked to repeat and memorize.

4.        Activities. The activities related to the techniques in Part II
     of The Teacher's Handbook. They suggest ways in which to teach
     or learn the Basic Material, such as "acting out" or "role playing"
     a dialogue. Sometimes, the activities suggest ways to enrich the
     lesson with an excursion or a class-organized meal, for example.
     Try Lo suggest you own activities.

5.        Suggestions for Use. These suggestions are to help the stu-
     dents realize that competency at memorization in the classroom is
     no substitute for actual communication with speakers of Arabic.
     Sometimes the suggestions can be considered as homework assign-
     ments to be reported on the next day. Sometimes they will re-
     quire class time for you to organize the assignment. Get your
     teacher to help you make out shopping lists, or conduct interviews
     where necessary.

6.        Additional Material.   As we have said, the Additional Material
     is not required, though many students will want to learn all of it.
     You should go over the new words and phrases in class, to learn
     the correct pronunciation. Use the Additional Material for dic-
     tations or for writing practice where appropriate. Do not require
     that your students memorize the lists which appear in some of t1.3
     Additional Material, but make sure that you hear the correct
     pronunciation and have a chance to practice saying it.

                                    Lesson One




Objectives.    1.      At the end of this lesson, you should be able to
                       greet men and women using the appropriate forms,
                       and you should be able to respond to several com-
                       mon greetings yourself.


Translation    Ahmed:      Hello!
of Dialogue:
               John:       Hello:
               Ahmed:      How are you?
               John:       Fine, thanks

Activities:    1.   Memorize the dialogue.
               .1
                       Practice the dialogue with your teacher or with
                       another student, taking turns with the two roles.
               3.   Pay attention to your teacher's pronunciation of the
                    dialogue. Try to imitate the correct pronunciation
                    as best you can.

Suggestions    1.   Use this greeting with people in shops that you en-
for Use-            ter, offices you have business in. and whenever you
                    see someone for the first time in the day.
               9    If you get- a response different from the ones you
                    have learned. make a note of it and learn what it
                    means.   Remember that in basic greeting situations,
                    speakers of Arabic often use several different ways
                    of asking the same question -- "How are you?", and
                    many ways of saying -well- or "fine".
               3.   Copy the Arabic dialogue in a notebook and have
                    your teacher look it over.

BASIC MATERIAL:     Dialogue for Memorization.
          /ahmad/         /is-sala:mu calay-kum/
          /ju:n/          /ucalay-kum is-sala:m/
          /ahmad/         /ya:k la ba:s?/
          /ju:n/          /la ba:s il-huindu li-lla:h/



 Notes on the Dialogue:
 1.    Greetings in the Arab world tend to be lengthier than in the
       West.   Be prepared to shake hands frequently - -ever with
       every person in a room or office. Hands are shaken for
       longer, and often are held for a few moments while talking.
       Failure to greet people properly (i.e. the American tendency
       to want to get "right down to business") may be considered
       rather abrupt. (See note on women shaking hands in this
       lesson.)
 2      /is-sala:mu calay-kum/ literally means "the peace upon you",
      - and is said by the person arriving or entering.
 3     /ya:k la ba:s/ is a question which literally means "is there no
       harm?"
 4.    The response /la ba:s/ means "no harm".
 5.    /il-hamdu li-lla:h/ literally means "the praise to God", and is
       frequently used where we would say "thank goodness".

Objective:     After learning this dialogue, you should be able to use
               alternative greetings.

Translation    Fatima:   Hello!
of bialogue:
               Jane:     Hello.
               Fatima:   How are you?
               Jane:     Fine, thanks.
               Fatima:   (Fine), thanks.

Activities:    1.   Memorize the dialogue and use it in practice with
                    members of your class.


Suggestions    1.   Copy the Arabic dialogue in a notebook and have
for Use:            your teacher look it over.


 Cultural Note:
 Women may find a slightly different form of greetings etiquette than
 men. Older men, for example, may not readily shake hands with
 women, and women are advised not to force the situation. Observe
 the exchange of greetings between women when you have the oppor-
 tunity.

 2.   the response /illa-l-khayr/ means "nothing but the good"                  .



 3.   Note the use of /il-hamdu li-lla :h/ alone as a reinforcement of
      the praise to God.

  Cultural Note:
  You will hear a wide range of alternatives for greetings, courtesy
  phrases and other everyday vocabulary. These tend to vary from
  area to area within the country and according to the educational
  level of speakers. It can be very frustrating when learning a new
  language to hear several versions of something you have just
  learned, but Arabic, like English, is an extremely rich and varied
  language, and as a first-time learner you must make the effort
  to memorize several words and phrases with approximately the same
  meaning which can be used interchangeably. Keep your ears open
  and whenever you hear a new word or phrase, try to write it down
  and ask your teacher or a Mauritanian friend what it means.




SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL:            Standard Arabic greetings. (useful for
dealing with expatriate Arabs).
     Good morning!       /saba:h il-khayr/
     (greeting)
     Good morning.       /saba :h in-nu:r/
     (response)
(Sometimes you will hear the following alternative
response to the above greeting.)
     Good morning.        ,c
                               alay-na wa calay-kum/
     (response)

     Good evening!       ,masa: il-khayr/
     (greeting)
     Good evening.       /masa: il-khayr/
     (response)
(Sometimes you will hear the same alternative
response to the above greeting.)
    Good evening.        /calay-na wa calay-kum/

Su  estions   1.   Practice the alternative greetings for "Good morning"
or Use:            and "good evening". Listen for these phrases in
                   Arabic conversations you will hear around you in
                   taxis, markets, offices, etc. Try to vary your own
                   greetings and responses and to use the appropriate
                   forms for different tunes of the day.
              2.   Use these examples for writing practice.          Get your
                   teacher to look over yourefforts.

      /jayn/              /ma ta : ri shay/

      /fa:timatu/         /ism-i fa: timatu/


 Notes on the Dialogue:
 1.     /ash t a:ri?/ means "what new?"         Note the absence of the
        verb "is" where it would be used in English.
        /shinhu ism-ik?/ literally means "what name your?" There is
        no verb "to be" in Arabic. The suffix /ik/ is a possessive
        pronoun. For further explanation see "Possessive Pronouns"
        in the Grammar Handbook.
       /inti/ is the feminine pronoun "you" (singular). /inta/ is the
       masculine pronoun "you" (sing.) See Grammar Handbook les-
       son on personal pronouns for further reference.

  Notes on the Additional Material.
  Among the useful words and phrases in the list you will find both
  Hassaniya expressions (those which are specific to Mauritanian
  speakers) and Standard equivalents (those which are understood
  over a wide area in the Arabic-speaking .world.) Both expressions
  are readily understood by Mauritanians.


Suggestions    I.     Practice saving these expressions and learn as many
for Use               of them as you can. It can be helpful to make
                      index cards for each new word or expression.
                      Write the English meaning and the transliteration on
                      one side, and write the Arabic on the other. Learn
                      them well enough to erase the transliteration, and
                      rely only on the Arabic.



 Cultural Note:     Names in Mauritania
 In   traditional Arab societies, the family name (the "last name") is
 transmitted by the father, just as it is in the West, but the "last
 name" in this case is the given of the father, so that it changes
 from   generation to generation. For example, Brahim has two
 children, Mohammed and Khadijatu. They are called Mohammed wul
 Brahim ("mohammed the son of Brahim") and Khadijatu mint Brahim
 ("Khadijatu the daughter of Brahim")    If Brahim's father was
                                            .



 called Bashir, Mohammed's geneology could be traced through his
 name: Mohammed wul Brahim wul Bashir ... etc. If Brahim had
 made the pilgrimage to Mecca, he would be given the name "Hajj"
 (pilgrim):   El Hajj Brahim wul Bashir.

 Cultural Note on numbers             "Arabic Numerals"
 The cipher. the so-called Arabic numerals, and the decimal system
 of notation were all invented by the Indians, but it was the Arabs
 who handed them on to Europe. thus making   possible
 day arithmetic as we know it, but also far-reachingnot only every-

 intellectual power,, had not been able to embark upon without   the
 cipher and the Arabic numerals.
The Arabic numerals which you see here are written in the form
which is widely used in other parts
                                          of the Arab world.      In
Mauritania. auto license plates and most signs   utilize the Western

               Mike.                   From         B


Activities     1        Practice the conversation, filling in                   the blanks
                        with appropriate place names.
               .1
                        Learn the pronunciation of these place names as
                        well as others which you feel will be important.
              J.        Ask people m your class or training program where
                        they come from. Report back to the class.

Suggestions   1.        Because many people in a capital city like Nouakchott
for Use:                have come from ccner places, it can be interesting to
                        find out where they are from. An informal survey
                        would probably produce surprising results.
              .1
                        Use the Arabic dialogue as writing praaice.                      Write
                        it out until you can produce consistent copies of
                        either the model in the book, or your teacher's
                        handwriting.

 2.    /gutlak/ means "Say..." or "Tell me..." or "By the way..."
 3.    /ana min.. ./ literally means "I-from", and is another example of
       the absence in Arabic of the verb "be" where it would be used hi
       English.

ADDITIONAL MATERIAL:



 Note on high numbers:
 Since there are 45 ougiya to the U.S. dollar you will have to get
 use to dealing with much higher figures when dealing with the cost
 of things. A relatively small shopping list will cost you several
 hundred, if not a thousand ougiya Concentrate on learning to use
 and understand high numbers quickly. The numbers 11-19 are
 given here, 20-100, 100-1000, and 1000-1,000,000 are given in Ad-
 ditional sections in Lessons Four, Five, and Seven. If you have
 immediate use of all the numbers refer forward to these Additional
 sections in class or on your own.

Activities:    1.   Memorize the numbers 11-20
              2.    Play a "numbers game" with your teacher or a class-
                    mate.     You give the "odd" numbers, your teacher
                    or classmate the "even" numbers
              3.    Get your teacher        to write out   the numbers in
                    Arabic.    Copy them into your copybook. You will
                    not have many occasions to write out numbers in
                    words, but it is good practice. Notice the similar-
                    ities with the numbers 1-10.
              4.    Write out the numbers 1-20 in Arabic, figures; get
                    used to recognizing them.



              Look at this illustration showing the numbers 1, 5, 10
              and 20 as used on the four basic coins of the Mauritan-
              ian monetary system.        Compare your pocket change with
              thes( in the photograph and read the Arabic on them.

                                                       & FAMILY INFORMATION



BASIC MATERIAL:        Dialogue for Memorization.

      /su:za:n/             /candi arba c a/



 Notes on the Dialogue:
 1.     A married man would be /mitkhayyim /, which means literally
        "sharing a tent". Adjectives describing people reflect the
        gender of the person described. Therefore, masculine and fem-
        inine adjectives will be different. See Gender (of Adjectives)
        in the Grammar Handbook.
 2.     /ahi:h/, "yes," and /abda/, "no", are words peculiar to Has-
        saniya, but Volunteers in other parts of the country may
        hear other words used.
 3.     /ma:ni/ means "I am not".         See the section on Negatives in
        the Grammar Handbook.
 4.     /cand-ik/ literally means "near you". See the Grammar
        Handbook for further information about this important
        structure in the section on "Have/Have Got."
 5.     /usrat-ik/ means "family-your".        Other words you may hear
        are / a:9.1a/ and /ahl/.      See Grammar Handbook lesson note
        on suffix pronouns.
 6.     /kam/ means "how many" or "how much" (except with prices,
        for which /ba:sh/ is used.)
 7.     /il-akhu:t/ means "brother -s" , /il -akhaw : t/ "sisters".

ADDITIONAL MATERIAL:           Days of the Week.
The names of most of the days of the week are closely allied to the num-
bers one through six:
       Sunday            /yawm it -had/                                       k           - )-

       Saturday           /yawm is-sibt/                                  .       k         y....




  Notes on days of the week:
  1.     The Arabic names for the first five days of the week, Sunday
         through Thursday, are derived from the same words as the
         numbers one   five; in fact, the words for Monday, Tuesday
         and Wednesday are exactly like the numbers 2,3 and 4. The
         words for Sunday and Thursday are only slightly different
         from the numbers one and four.
  2,     /yawm/ means "day" - so the names of the days of the week
         are simply 'day the one', 'day the two' etc.

is "one and twenty", etc.

                     You will be able to ask the price of. something and use
                     the appropriate polite formulae for terminating a con-
                     versation.

 Translation     Customer:           Hello.
 of Dialogue:    Shopkeeper:         Hello.
                 Customer:           Do you have any rice today?
                 Shopkeeper:         Yes, of course.
                 Customer:           How much is a kilo?
                 Shopkeeper:         It's 13 ougiya.
                 Customer:           O.K. Give me a kilo please.
                 Shopkeeper:         Here you are.
                 Customer:           Thank you. Goodbye.
                 Shopkeeper:         Goodbye.

Activities:      1.     Practice saying the lines of the dialogue with
                                                                   a class-
                        mate, a friend, or your teacher. Switch roles
                        try to memorize one part.                     and
                2.      Set up a table or window as a shop stall. Choose
                        common items you might find in a Mauritanian shop
                        and conduct a role-play shopping situation.
Suggestions     1.      Go on a "scavenger hunt" through the central souk.
for Use:                Look closely at the stalls in which common house-
                        hold items are sold. Make a list of the most com-
                        mon items you see.      Compare notes with classmates
                        and learn the Arabic names for the most interest-
                        ing items.
                2.      Befriend a shopkeeper or merchant in your neighbor-
                        hood. Should you be invited to sit for awhile or to
                        drink tea, take advantage of the opportunity to lis-
                        ten to typical exhanges between the shopkeeper and
                        customers.

 Notes on the Dialogue:
 1.     /kha:lig/ is a common word which means "there is/is there?"
        (masc.) and is used in making statements or asking questions
        about availability or existence. /kha:Igal is the feminine
        form and /kha:lgi:n/ is the plural.
 2.     /ma:ru/ is an African-derived word for "rice".
 3.     /kha:lig bacacy is an expression which means "Of course
        there is." /b ad/ is also used after other words to reinforce

  Since most of the fruits and vegetables folind in Nouakchott are
  imported the use of French to identify rhem is probably more
  common than Arabic. However, look at the list of several common
  vegetables identifiable in this picture. and learn the names of
  others which you find in the "boutiques.' or "supermarches" of the
  capital. You may be surprised to learn that many Maures seldom
  eat vegetables at all.


Vocabulary :
     onions          bus]
     potatoes         bumditayri
     carrots          ka.rut/

     tomat,,es       'tama:ti

Activities       1   Find out the words for "okra", "eggplant", "cab-
                     bage".   -auliflower". "squash" or zucchini, and
                     "cucumber"     Many of these words in French, but
                     try to see if you can find out the Arabic.

  Cultural Note on Markets in the Arabic World:
 A central market or /sug, ("marsa" in Mauritania) is an important
 feature of most Arab cities. Here goods and products are bought
 and sold, and the activities serve as a social focal point for both
 men and women. At the time of this writing, the central market in
 Nouakchott has ceased to function due to a fire. The activities of
 the market have been dispersed to a variety of locations, including
 sidewalk stalls such as vou see in the illustration here

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL:        Grammar Note.
   Present Tense Verbs.
   The present tense in Arabic obeys a regular and predictable pat-
   tern: each verb consists of a "stem", in most cases made up of
   three letters, which carries the meaning of the verb. "I," "you,"
   "he," "she" etc., are indicated by prefixe's and suffixes added to
   the "stem". These prefixes and suffixes remain absolutely con-
   stant from one verb to another.
   The prefixes are added to the "stem" by ore of the short vowels,
   which we call the "helper" vowel which remains the same within
   any one verb.      You may hear some regional differences in
   Mauritania as to which short vowel is used as the helper vowel in
   some verbs. Keep your ears open and imitate what you hear most
   used around you in your town.
   Here is the verb "speak":
   I speak              /nitkallam/

   you speak (m)        /titkallam/

   you speak (f)        /titkallami/

   he speaks            /yitkallam/

   she speaks           /titkallam/

   we speak             /nitkallamu/

   you speak (pi)       /titkallamu/

   they speak           /yitkallamu/
   (For fufther information, refer to the section on "Verbs" in the
   Grammar Handbook).

 Cul`ural Note:
 Spend time with children, as they are excellent language resources
 and very good teachers as they have a limited vocabulary and are
 willing to repeat things far more often than some adults. Find out
 what you can about the educational system h Mauritania, both tradi-
 tional and modern. Do not be surprised if many people you meet are
 unable to read and write Arabic and express surprise that you can
 do so yourself.

               TALKING ABOUT AND LEARNING ARABIC
                                Lesson Nine




Objective:     By learning these basic phrases you should be able
               to get yourself out of French-speaking situations when
               you would prefer to use your Arabic. You should also
               begin to learn when and where Arabic is appropriate.


Translation    Mohammed:        Hello.        (in French)
of Dialogue:
               John:            Hello.        (in Arabic)
               Mohammed:        What do you want?            (in French)
               John:            I don't speak French.             (in Arabic)
               Mohammed:        You speak Arabic?
               John:            Yes.     It     trying!


Activities:    If your teacher is also a French speaker, he or she
               can act out the part of Mohammed, who insists, at first,
               on speaking French with a European. Act out the dia-
               logue, memorizing the lines of the learner.
Sugge2tions    Learn to judge the appropriateness of language use
for Use:       in Mauritania.   There are clearly situations where you
               will have to use some French in order to communicate,
               but many people who are not native speakers of
               Hassaniya can still communicate with you in Arabic.

      /ju:n/              /ahi:h nuha:wil/


 Notes on the Dialogue:
 1.    /ma nitkallam/ shows the use of the negative with verbs.
       /ma/ before a verb make3 it negative. Set- Grammar Handbook
       lesson on Negatives with verbs.
 2.    Aaransa:wia/ means "French" (adj.) or "the French lan-
       guage".
 3.    /nuha : wil/ means "I try".



 Cultural No Le on Language Use in Mauritania:
You will face a number of obstacles in learning Arabic in
Nouakchott. As a European, you will find that most people will
automatically address you in French, and even answer you in
French should you begin by speaking Arabic. You will have to
insist on using Arabic where it is appropriate. Although some
culture groups in Mauritania do not speak Arabic, many in
Nouakchott readily understand it. You will need to learn some
basic French (xclich will come to you quite easily comparised
to Arabic, because of its similarity to English). Make sure that
whatever you learn to say in French you also learn to say in
Arabic. If you learn a new word from a sign or an advertismt -t,
look for the Arabic script translation as well. You may wit. :o
learn more about the African languages in use in part of Mauritania.
For further reference, see Lesson 20 in the Literacy Handbook.

                                                              LESSON TEN




Suggestions        If you are invited to have tea with Mauritanian
for Use:           friend, ask to observe the ceremonyasurrounding
                   the making of the tea.
              2.   Write out the Arabic of this Lesson for further
                   practice.
              3.    Use this "operation" (making tea) as a model for
                    describing simple processes.   Try to construct
                   other simple operations (boiling an egg,
                   rice or cous-cous, washing a wound, etc.)cooking
                                                              which
                   you can perform and learn the Arabic for from  an
                   informant. Learn any vocabulary necessary for
                   your own work.       Refer to the Supplementary

                                                                  YOU LIVE




BASIC MATERIAL:       Dialogue for Memorization.
       /nafi: sa/     -    /kam 1-ik vi nu:akshu:t?/
       /bitsi/             /shahrayn tagri:ban/
       /nafi: sa/     -    /mnayn sa:kina?/
       /bitsi/             /cand-i da : r gari:ba min il-masjid il-jadi : d/
       /nafi:sa/           /il- masjid is-sucu:di?/
       /bitsi/        -    /ahi:h hagg/


 Notes on the Dialogue:
  1.     /kam 1-ik/ means "how much for you?" addressed to a woman.
         /kam 1-ak/ is the form for a man. See Grammar Handbook
         lesson on Interrogatives.
  2.     The suffix /-ayn/ added to a noun makes it "dual" or "two of"
         the same. See Grammar Handbook lesson on Plurals.
 3.      /tagri:ban/ means "about" or "approximately".
 4.      /sa:kina/ means literally "living". To a man, you would say
         /mnayn sa:kin?/. The verb in this case is what we call an
          "Active Participle". See Grammar Handbook for further ex-
         planation.
  5.     /gari:ba min/ means literally "near from". In this case, the
         feminine /gari:ba/ is used since /da:r/ is feminine.
  6.     /il-masjid it -jadi:d/ literally means "the mosque the new".
         For an explanation of this, see the Section on "Adjectives with
          Nouns" in the Grammar Handbook.
  7.      /is-sucu:di/ here is an adjective meaning "Saudi" (Arabian).
  8.      /hagg/ means "That's right." or "That's correct."
                                                                                    -....-1

       /taksi ma:n/          /waddacna-k it -mula : na/


 Notes on the Dialogue:
  1.       /wa:cid/ comes from a word meaning to have an al.. ointment
           and is used here to mean "Where are you going?"
  2.       /irkib/ is the imperative of the verb meaning to "get in", or
           "get on (e.g. a horse). To a woman it would be /irkibi/.
           See Grammar Handbook lesson on Imperatives for further refer-
           ence.
 3.        /maca sha:ric/ literally means "with the street" but translates
           here as "at" or "on".



  Cultural Note:
  You will notice that French expressions are widely used in indicating
  directions, money. time and for titles. Names of streets and neighbor-
  hoods may also be identified by their French names.                 Taxis in
 Nouakchott generally circulate along two principal routes: north and
 south along Ave. Kennedy out to the 5eme and along Ave. Nasser be-
 tween the hospital and the Ksar. Taking a taxi in a straight line on
 either of these two routes costs 10 u.m. If you wish to deviate from
 these routes in order to go to a particular location, the cost will be 20
  u.m.

Suggestions
for Use:      1.   Study each picture carefully and think about what
                   each might suggest about development problems and
                   solutions in Mauritania.
              2.   Ask your teacher for the vocabulary you need to
                   hold a discussion on these topics.
              3.   Prepare a small "speech" about one of the topics
                   and give it to the class.
              4.   Refer back to these pictures after you have com-
                   pleted the last lessons in the book on health and
                   agriculture, and add more ideas at that time.

BASIC MATERIAL:       Dialogue for memorization:
      /inta/          /shinhu il-wagt?/
      /ahmad/         /ha: dhi Cashra wa nuss/
      /inta/          /nacam?/

      /inta/          /shukran. vi aman illa:h/
      /ahmad/         /vi aman illa:h/




 Notes on the Dialogue:
 1.     Another way to ask the time is /esmin wagt/. You may hear
        this in certain parts of the country.
 2.     Note the use of the feminine form /ha:dhi/ when used with a
        clock time.
 3.     /na cam/ is one of many ways to ask someone to repeat what
        they said.
 4.     /vi aman illa:h/ is another Standard Arabic leave-taking.

TIME
UNDERSTANDING TIME IN THE ARAB WORLD                  LESSON FOURTEEN




 Cultural Note:
 In the Arab world, the concepts of time and space are not viewed
 with such awe as in other cultures. Things take place on a human
 level; people are more important than events. A common Arabic
 proverb says:
       Haste is from the Devil.
       /il-cajla min ish-shayta:n/
                                                6 `-14\          -0, i,1,,s61
 Punctuality is not as important in the Arab world as it is for us in
 the West. The philosophy governing appointments is that implied in
 the expression:
       God willing.
                                                          4
       /in sha' alla:h/                                 ck.)31    ,V.,:, 3k,
 If God wills that the appointment be kept, it will be kept. If God
 doesn't, it won't, and there is nothing that can be done and no
 reason to be upset. It was simply not fated to happen. This can
 be very frustrating for Westerners, who have just as mystical an
 attachment to a rational, ordered and controllable time frame as the
 Arabs do to the idea that nothing is for certain. What is at con-
 flict here is not just respect for time, but a more profound dif-
 ference in perception of time. So when people say to you that they
 will meet you at six o'clock, God willing, it does not mean neces-
 sarily that they will not be there, but the possibility exists. You
 should not complain if they are twenty minutes late. Always bear
 in mind that things which we hold sacrosanct in our own culture
 are not always regarded in the same light or considered as im-
 portant in other cultures. If you in turn should be late and ready
 to apologize profusely, the first thing you are likely to hear is
       "it doesn't matter"
             or                   /la ba : s/
       "never mind"

Cultural Note:
"N'shallah" (if God willed or God willing) is a formula employed by
Muslims following any reference to the future or to projected plans.
This "N'shallah" is often interpreted by Westerners as expressive of
Arab fatalism, but might just as well be explained as a humility in
the face of the limitations of man's capabilities.

Activities (cont'd from page 116):
               2.   Choose the name of a third person (Ahmed,
                    Fatimatu, etc.) and make up a fictionalized
                    account of his/her morning activities. Learn
                    new vocabulary from your teacher where necessary.
               3.   Translate the following questions into Arabic and
                    ask each other about daily routines:
                    When do you get up?
                    What do you do after you get up?
                    Do you make tea or coffee?
                    Do you always eat breakfast?
                    When do you go to work?
                    How do you go to work?
              4.    Use the pictures on the next page to practice furth-
                    er questions and responses.


Suggestions   1.    Since these are what might be called "personal
for Use:            information questions", caution might be advised
                    in making "random surveys" using questions like
                    these. These are the kinds of questions, however,
                    which persons involved in health projects often
                    have to ask regarding health and nutrition.
              2.    Make up simple step-by-step accounts of other daily
                    activities. Learn from your teacher how to say
                    activities which seem important.

 Notes on the Basic Material:
 1.    /iclya:t/, "women", is considerably different from the singular,
       /mara/. See Grammar Handbook for more information on plurals.
 2.    /ya:sir min/ literally means "a lot from".
 3.    Note that in the vocabulary listed here, the verbs are in-
       troduced in the masculine participle form. See Grammar Hand-
       book for further information on the use of participles.

     Cultural Note:
     It is considered important to extend your personal greetings to
     families whom you have met, even if only briefly. If you are in-
     vited to a Mauritanian home for a meal, you are not expected to
     bring tokens or presents for your hosts, or to contribute anything
     to the meal. Expect to spend a long time before, during and after a
     meal. and to be exhorted to eat copious amounts of everything.
     Your hosts will pride themselves on the hospitality they are ex-
     tending. and attention will be paid to the enthusiasm which you
     bring to the consumption of food. This is traditional Arab hos-
     pitality at its best, and can be one of the most satisfying aspects
     to your stay in Mauritania.

     "The most important of the ritual and moral duties incumbent on all
     Muslims are prayer. almsgiving. fasting and pilgraTage. Custom
     and tradition have supplied the gaps which the Qur an leaves and
     have welded its prescriptions into a well-defined system, based
     theoretically "n the practice of the Prophet himself. For the broad
     outlines doubtless ths Prophet's example was faithfully recorded and
     adopted.    The Qur an appears to require only three prayers a

     day. but the tradition insists on five: the first begins at sunset,
     and is followed by the night, dawn. noon and mid-afternoon prayers.
     The faithful are called to prayer by the muadhdhin, who.. cries with
     a powerful and penetrating voice: 'God is most great. I testify
     that there is no God but God. I testify that Muhammed is God's
     apostle. Come to prayer, come to security. God is great.' Each
1    clause is repeated at least once and the morning call reminds

     Muslims that 'prayer is better than sleep.'"

 news so that the beginning of the fast can be broadcast nationally. In
 some countries the news is announced by the firing of a cannon.
 Fasting means abstaining from all food and drink, smoking and sexual
 intercourse from that moment in the early morning when it is possible to
 distinguish a black thread from a white thread. It continues through
 the hours of daylight until the sun sinks below

 Certain people are exempt from fasting; the sick, pregnant women,
 young children and travellers. Travellers and the sick and pregnant,
 too are expected to fast an equal number of days later, at their con-

The rhythm of the days is slower in Ramadan; daytime activity is kept
to a minimum. Some shops may close and ministries and offices

Often special foods and delicacies prepared during Ramadan are served...
In Mauritania, dates and milk are in abundance.
The end of Ramadan is celebrated by a holiday known as:

                     or

       Nazarenes, the disciples of Jesus of Nazareth, and by ex-
       tension, Christians or Europeans in general. More popularly,
       it refers to all Europeans or non-Muslims, with no religious

 Cultural Note: #1.
 Try to find out the major differences of ideology between Christian-
 ity and Islam. A good reference book would be A. Guillaume's
 Islam, published by Penguin, Harmsworth, Ltd., London. If you
 are involved in a religious discussion which becomes a little
 "touchy", a good rejoinder that all Muslims accept is /kull-na ahl
 it -kita:b/ - "we are all people of The Book."

LESSON TWENTY                TALKWG ABOUT RELIGION IN THE U.S.




 Cultural Note: #2.
 You h ve learned that the Arabic word for "Christian" or "Euro-
 pean" (including North Americans) is /nasra:ni /, which is derived
 from "Nazerenes". Islamic principles dictate respect for the other
 two monotheistic faiths, calling both Christians and Jews "people of
 the book." Jesus Christ is respected as a teacher and an early
 prophet. However, Mohammad is regarded as the last prophet or
 messenger of God's will.
 "Submission" is one of the key tenets of Islam and devout Muslims
 show a much greater daily involvement in the practices of their
 faith then we might consider usual in the West. Five times a day
 prayer is but one example of this. So don't be surprised if Muslim
 people consider Christianity a bit "soft". Westerners' ability to be
 secular individuals during the week. and church-goers on Sunday
 may seem odd to your Muslim friends.
 In spite of the predominance of religion in daily lives, you will be
 judged in Mauritania not by the outward display of your faith, but
 by the manner in which you treat people. Warmth and equal con-
 sideration for everyone, no matter what their standing, will earn
 you respect and admiration.

                DESCRIBING PAST EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES
                              Lesson Twenty-One




Objective:       At the end of this lesson, you will be able to use the
                 past tense of common verbs in order to describe past
                 events and activities.

Translation      Last Thursday I went to see my friend who lives in
of Narrative:        (place)   . We went by car and arrived at 11:00
                 in the morning. I visited my friend at the clinic.
                 I talked to her director. Later we all had lunch together.
                 We returned to Nouakchott in the evening.
                 New vocabulary:
                      I visited                we returned
                      we arrived               we had lunch
                      I see                    together
                      who (rel.)

Activities:      1.   Memorize the narrative and tell the story to your
                      classmates. Make any changes that P re appropriate
                      with the help of your teacher.
                 2.   Study the verb forms in the special Gram:nar
                      Supplement to this Lesson. Change the narrative
                      by retelling the story about another person. Use
                      "they", "his", etc.

Suggestions      1.   A "narrative" or account of past or recent activities
for Use:              can sometimes be "elicited" in a conversation by
                      asking the simple question:
                      What did you do          yesterday?
                                               last week
                                               in Dakar etc.

DESCRIP I'mG PAST EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES               LESSON TWENTY-ONE




SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL:           Grammar Note.
    The past tense in Arabic is formed by adding suffixes to the last
    letter of the "stem" of the verb These suffixes are regular and
                                            .

    constant from one verb to another and indicate the equivalents to
    the English "I" , "you" , "he" , "she" , etc  .


    Here is the verb "speak" in the past tense;
           I spoke              /tkallamt/
           you spoke (m )   .   /tkallamt/
           you spoke (f )       /tkallamti/
           he spoke             /tkallam/
           she spoke            /tkallamat/
           we spoke             /tkallamna/
           you spoke (pl )  .   /tkallamtu/
           they spoke           /tkallamu/

   Verbs which have a /wa : w/ as the middle letter in the present
   tense drop it in the past tense and conform to the pattern shown
   below   .


   Here is the verb "see" :
        I saw                   /shivt/
        you saw (m . )          /shivt/
        you saw (f . )          /shivti/
        he saw                  /sha: v/
        she saw                 /sha : vat/
        we saw                  /shivna/
        you saw (pl )   .       /shivtu/
        they saw                /sha: vu/                          "
   Check with your teachers the other verbs you have encountered that
   follow this pattern. Note that the suffixes indicating the different

LESSON TWENTY-ONE         DESCRIBING PAST EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES




   Verbs which have /ya : / as the last letter in the present tense
   undergo the slight changes in pronunciation outlined in the
   example show below: Here is the verb "go" or "walk" :
        I went               /mashi: t/                         CL..........A2u.

        you went (m . )     /mashi: t/                           c........1,
        you went (f . )      /mashi: ti/
        he went             /masha/
        she went            /mashat/                                    :,..
       we went              /mashi: na/
        you went (pl. )     /mashi: tu/
       they went            /mashaw/
       (Check with your       teacher what other verbs follow this
       pattern . )
   Note that all verbs which follow the above pattern and those which
   follow the pattern of "see on the previous page will behave it the
   same way as the examples shown here. You must be aware of the
   vowel changes that occur within verbs when comparing them to
   their present tense forms .

                                Lesson Twenty-Four




Objective:             At the end of this lesson you should be able to tell
                       about an outing in the desert, or a visit to an en-
                       campment or small town. You should also be able
                       to use the grammatical structures necessary for de-
                       scribing past events.

Translation of
Basic Material:        Yesterday Jane and I went to Boutilimit and on the
                       way, we saw a lot of camels in the desert.            When
                       we arrived at the encampment, Sheikh's mother was
                       making "zrig" and his father was buying meat at
                       the market. Later we all sat down together under
                       the tent and ate cous-cous and drank tea. When we
                       finished    the meal the girls (put henna on their
                       hands).

Activities:       1.   Listen to your teacher reading the narrative.
                       Think about the scene being described.
                  2.   Practice making "WH-questions" ("What did you see
                       in the desert?", "Where did you go?", etc.), listen-
                       ing to or repeating some of the answers your
                       teacher gives.
                  3.   Retell the narrative in your own words, asking
                       your teacher for help as you need. Try to vary
                       some of the details of the story as appropriate.

Suggestions:      1.   Find out the names of Mauritanian dishes such as
                       /zrig/, /mafi/, "chebbijin", and "cous-cous", and
                       see if you can learn how to make them.

        lustrates a reflexive verb in Hassaniya.


Cultural Note:
/vi ta:rig/, "on the road," or "along the way" can be expressed in
several other ways in Hassaniya. "Goudron," a French word for
asphalt or tarmac, is often used to mean simply "the paved road", a
relatively new phenomenon in Mauritanian life.

Note:   Also see Health Glossary elsewhere in this Handbook for further
health-related vocabulary.



 Cultural Note:
 Because of a tendency among Arabs to spare you bad news, or to
 avoid talking directly about something like the ill health of a loved
 one , a certain persistence may be
                                     necessary in order to divine the
 cause of an illness or complaint. Note that the question for "What's
 the matter?" translates best as "How are you?" and your first re-
 sponse to such a question is likely to be "fine".

Activity: Find out the names of the Islamic months. You have already
seen two - Ramadan and Hajj, which are the two most well-known.
Although the Islamic months exist side-by-side with the Gregorian
months, the latter are used much more frequently in everyday
Mauritanian life.

                                Lesson Thirty




Objective:    At the end of this dialogue you should be able to further
              your inquiries about local agriculture, and practice using
              the conditional in Arabic.


Translation   Sam:        Hello. What did you plant here?
of Blsic      Ah:nad:     I   planted beets     here and corn over there.
Material:     Sam:        Did you put fertilizer on the field?
              Ahmad:      No.    There isn't any in this area.
              Sam:        If you use (used) fertilizer the crops will grow
                          better.
              Ahmad:      If you bring (brought) me a little, I will put
                          it. (on the crops)
              Sam:        I'll speak to my director tomorrow. If I haven't
                          brought it to you before Friday, come to the
                          office in Nouakchott and I'll give you a sack
                          of it.


Activities:   1.     Using the words from the Agricultural Glossary in
                     Lesson 29, substitute the names of other agricultural
                     crops and products as answers to the first question.
                     Learn any regional alternatives for the agricultural
                     vocabulary used in this Lesson.
              2.     Practice this dialogue in class with your teacher.
                     Discuss the agricultural patterns and practices
                     of the different regions of Mauritania.

## Recommended Training Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Validation
```bash
# Use: train_phase1_curated.jsonl
# Samples: 28,176
# Epochs: 3
# Time: ~1-2 hours
# Purpose: Verify pipeline works, check for obvious issues
```

### Phase 2: Main Training
```bash
# Use: train_phase2_quality.jsonl
# Samples: 28,612
# Epochs: 3-5
# Time: ~4-8 hours
# Purpose: Primary fine-tuning run
```

### Phase 3: Evaluation
```bash
# Use: eval_holdout.jsonl
# Samples: 200
# Purpose: Test model on held-out examples
```

## Quality Improvements Made

1. ✅ **Deduplicated** - Removed duplicate samples across source files
2. ✅ **Quality Scored** - Each sample scored on structure and content
3. ✅ **Tiered** - Separated into quality tiers for phased training
4. ✅ **Evaluation Set** - Created held-out test set for benchmarking
5. ✅ **Validation Split** - Proper train/val split for monitoring

---

## Ready for Fine-Tuning

Your dataset is now optimized and ready. Start with Phase 1 to validate your training pipeline, then proceed to Phase 2 for the main training run.
